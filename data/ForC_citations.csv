 efflux in a Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) forest stand are reported for a
6-month period (from May 1st to October 26th 1999). Forest floor CO2
 efflux was measured at four positions using a portable infrared gas analyser (LI-COR), operating as a closed dynamic system and connected to a portable soil chamber. Soil CO2
 efflux was
measured 3–4 times per month. Soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm was recorded during the whole period with an interval of ten
minutes. An exponential regression was used to describe the relationship between soil temperature and soil CO2
 efflux. On the basis
of this relationship Q10 values were calculated. The averaged value of Q10 for the studied Norway spruce forest stand was 3.74.",1

Basic environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture were measured. All the four investigated sites showed a positive dependence of the soil surface CO2 efflux on soil temperature. The four datasets generally resulted in good agreement (up to 93%) between the approaches and residual analysis showed no significant difference between approaches (less than 8%).

Control and N-fertilized (125 kg urea-N ha-1 y-1) treatments were represented by four replicate plots (each 40 x 40 m, separated by at least 40 m). Stem diameter growth was analysed by diameter at breast height classes and also for the three most abundant species. The three species did not respond to N addition. The response of stem growth and above-ground woody biomass production to N fertilization varied among dbh classes. Stem growth of trees of 10-30 cm dbh increased only in the first year of N addition while trees of 30-50 cm dbh responded in the second year of N addition, which may be due to differences in light conditions between years. Trees >50 cm dbh did not respond during 2 years of N addition. As a result, the overall stem growth and above-ground woody biomass production were not affected by N fertilization. Annual total fine litterfall increased in the first year of N fertilization, while annual leaf litterfall increased in both years of N addition. Above-ground net primary production, of which total fine litterfall constituted 68%, also increased only in the first year of N addition. The magnitude and timing of response of stem diameter growth and litterfall suggest that these aspects of above-ground productivity are not uniformly limited by N availability.",1

We elevated the soil temperature by 3Â°C at 5-cm depth by using overhead infrared heaters and continuously measured hourly soil CO2 fluxes with a 15-channel automated chamber system. The 15 chambers were divided into three groups each with five replications for the control, unwarmed-trenched and warmed-trenched treatments. Soil warming enhanced heterotrophic respiration by 82% (mean of four seasons (2008-2011) observationÂ±SD, 6.84Â±2.22 Âµmol C m-2 s-1) as compared to the unwarmed-trenched treatment (3.76Â±0.98 Âµmol C m-2 s-1). The sustained enhancement of heterotrophic respiration with soil warming suggests that global warming will accelerate the loss of carbon substantially more from forested peatlands than from other upland forest soils. Soil warming likewise enhanced temperature sensitivity slightly (Q 10, 3.1Â±0.08 and 3.3Â±0.06 in the four-season average in unwarmed- and warmed-trenched treatments, respectively), and significant effect was observed in 2009 (p<0.001) and 2010 (p<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the basal respiration rate at 10Â°C (R 10, 2.2Â±0.52 and 2.8Â±1.2 Âµmol C m-2 s-1) between treatments, although the values tended to be high by warming throughout the study period. These results suggest that global warming will enhance not only the heterotrophic respiration rate itself but also its Q 10 in forests with high substrate availability and without severe water stress, and predictions for such ecosystems obtained by using models assuming no change in Q 10 are likely to underestimate the carbon release from the soil to the atmosphere in a future warmer environment.",1

Studies both in temperate and tropical forests have shown significant architectural differences associated with adult stature and light demand. 2 However, studies in temperate forests have not been as thorough in examining these relationships with respect to phylogeny and ontogeny, thus preventing a complete understanding of the patterns in temperate forests and limiting comparisons of the relationship between tropical and temperate forests. Therefore, we performed a community-level analysis of the relationship between tree form and ecology in a temperate forest with statistical consideration of phylogeny and ontogeny. 3 The height-diameter relationship throughout tree development was asymptotic in most species. Crown diameter and depth increased allometrically with tree height, with no asymptote. The tree height, crown diameter, and crown depth of small trees were estimated using these relationships and were similar to those reported for tropical species. 4 Taller species had more slender stems at any reference size and narrower crowns at small reference sizes, whereas crown depth was relatively independent of adult stature. Light-wooded species had narrower and shallower crowns at medium to large reference heights. Stem thickness was virtually independent of wood density throughout the size range. 5 Our results support the hypothesis that the architecture of short or shade-tolerant species is optimized for light capture and mechanical stability, whereas that of tall or light-demanding species is optimized for height growth. These relationships generally agree with results from studies in tropical rain forests, although considerable differences exist, and may potentially promote the stable coexistence of the species.

Once these lands are abandoned it is not clear if they will recover to forest or if they will become permanent grasslands. Economic changes in Puerto Rico have led to the abandonment of agricultural lands over the last 60 years, providing an opportunity to assess the longer term patterns of forest recovery following human disturbance. This study focuses on the changes in vegetation in abandoned pastures ranging in age from 0 to 60 years or more in two replicate chronosequences. Species richness and density of woody species were very low during the first 10 years following abandonment and woody biomass did not increase substantially until approximately 15 years post-abandonment. Recovery in pastures is greatly delayed in comparison with forest recovery following other types of human and natural disturbance. The successional trajectory is quite different in comparison to those following natural disturbances in the nearby Luquillo Mountains. In particular, the initial colonizing species are not â€˜typical' pioneer species (e.g. Cecropia sp., Scheffleria morotononi), but a group of shrubs and treelets in the Rubiaceae, Melastomataceae, and Myrtaceae. The presence of grasses and the rapid colonization and growth of ferns and herbaceous species in the abandoned pastures appears to be a major factor inhibiting the establishment of secondary forest and imparts a selective barrier on the colonizing woody species.",1

This unique history provides an excellent opportunity to study secondary forest succession and suggest strategies for tropical forest restoration. To determine the pattern of secondary succession, we describe the woody vegetation in 71 abandoned pastures and forest sites in four regions of Puerto Rico. The density, basal area, aboveground biomass, and species richness of the secondary forest sites were similar to those of the old growth forest sites (>80 yr) after approximately 40 years. The dominant species that colonized recently abandoned pastures occurred over a broad elevational range and are widespread in the neotropics. The species richness of Puerto Rican secondary forests recovered rapidly, but the species composition was quite different in comparison with old growth forest sites, suggesting that enrichment planting will be necessary to restore the original composition. Exotic species were some of the most abundant species in the secondary forest, but their long?term impact depended on life history characteristics of each species. These data demonstrate that one restoration strategy for tropical forest in abandoned pastures is simply to protect the areas from fire, and allow natural regeneration to produce secondary forest. This strategy will be most effective if remnant forest (i.e., seed sources) still exist in the landscape and soils have not been highly degraded. Patterns of forest recovery also suggest strategies for accelerating natural recovery by planting a suite of generalist species that are common in recently abandoned pastures in Puerto Rico and throughout much of the neotropics.",1

RS was measured twice monthly with the soda-lime method, and the incubation method was used to measure RSM and RFFM separately. The results were evaluated annually and over the 2-year research period. Correlation and stepwise regression analyses were used for statistical evaluation. Annual mean RS was significantly higher in thinned plots (1.92gCm-2day-1) than in the control plots (1.79gCm-2day-1). Over the 2-year research period, RS was higher in the thinned plots, and had linear correlations with GC, soil temperature and fine root biomass. GC was found to be the main factor that determined RS. The control plots had significantly higher RSM in first year, whereas the thinned plots had significantly higher RSM in second year; no significant difference was found over the 2-year research period. RFFM was significantly higher in the control plots than in the thinned plots, by 84% in the second year and by 34% over the 2-year study period.

As a consequence of changes in economy during the last century, areas of marginal agriculture have been abandoned leading to secondary successions. The encroachment of woody plants into grasslands, pastures and croplands is generally thought to increase the carbon stored in these ecosystems even though there are evidences for a decrease in soil carbon stocks after land use change. In this paper, we investigate the effects of woody plant invasion on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks along a precipitation gradient (200–2,500 mm) using original data from paired experiment in Italian Alps and Sicily and data from literature (Guo and Gifford Glob Change Biol 8(4):345–360, 2002). We found a clear negative relationship (?0.05% C mm?1) between changes in soil organic carbon and precipitation explaining 70% of the variation in soil C stocks after recolonization: dry sites gain carbon (up to +67%) while wet sites lose carbon (up to ?45%). In our data set, there seem to be two threshold values for soil carbon accumulation: the first one is 900 mm of mean annual rainfall, which separates the negative from the positive ratio values; the second one is 750 mm, which divides the positive values in two groups of sites. Most interestingly, this threshold of 750 mm corresponds exactly to a bioclimatic threshold: sites with <750 mm mean annual rainfall is classified as thermo-mediterranean sites, while the ones >750 mm are classified as mesomediterranean sites. This suggests that apart from rainfall also temperature values have an important influence on soil carbon accumulation after abandonment. Moreover, our results confirmed that the correlation between rainfall and trend in soil organic carbon may be related to nitrogen dynamics: carbon losses may occur only if there is a substantial decrease in soil nitrogen stock which occurs in wetter sites probably because of the higher leaching.",1

Structural equation modeling was employed to determine the direct and indirect effects of stand age and the residual effects of CWM and FDvar on aboveground biomass across 31 plots in secondary forests in subtropical China. The CWM model accounted for 78, 20, 6 and 2% of the variation in aboveground biomass, nitrogen concentration in young leaf, plant height and specific leaf area of young leaf, respectively. The FDvar model explained 74, 13, 7 and 0% of the variation in aboveground biomass, plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf, respectively. The variation in aboveground biomass, CWM of leaf nitrogen concentration and specific leaf area, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf explained by the joint model was 86, 20, 13, 7, 2 and 0%, respectively. Stand age had a strong positive direct effect but low indirect positive effects on aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to CWM of nitrogen concentration in young leaf, but positively related to CWM of specific leaf area of young leaf and plant height, and FDvar of plant height, twig wood density and nitrogen concentration in young leaf.

The Puechabon forest acted as a net C sink of -254 g C m-2 yr-1, with a GPP of 1275 g C m-2 yr-1 and a Reco of 1021 g C m-2 yr-1. On average, 83% of the net annual C sink occurred between March and June. The effects of exceptional events such the insect-induced partial canopy defoliation that occurred in spring 2005, and the spring droughts of 2005 and 2006 are discussed. A high interannual variability of ecosystem C fluxes during summer and autumn was observed but the resulting effect on the annual net C budget was moderate. Increased severity and/or duration of summer drought under climate change do not appear to have the potential to negatively impact the average C budget of this ecosystem. On the contrary, factors affecting ecosystem functioning (drought and/or defoliation) during March-June period may reduce dramatically the annual C balance of evergreen Mediterranean forests. ",1

However, in Mediterranean ecosystems, soil respiration may have a pulsed response to precipitation events, especially during prolonged dry periods. Here, we investigate temporal variations in soil respiration (Rs), soil temperature (T) and soil water content (SWC) under three different land uses (a forest area, an abandoned agricultural field and a rainfed olive grove) in a dry Mediterranean area of southeast Spain, and evaluate the relative importance of soil temperature and water content as predictors of Rs. We hypothesize that soil moisture content, rather than soil temperature, becomes the major factor controlling CO2 efflux rates in this Mediterranean ecosystem during the summer dry season. Soil CO2 efflux was measured monthly between January 2006 and December 2007 using a portable soil respiration instrument fitted with a soil respiration chamber (LI-6400-09). Mean annual soil respiration rates were 2.06Â Â±Â 0.07, 1.71Â Â±Â 0.09, and 1.12Â Â±Â 0.12Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the forest, abandoned field and olive grove, respectively. Rs was largely controlled by soil temperature above a soil water content threshold value of 10% at 0-15Â cm depth for forest and olive grove, and 15% for abandoned field. However, below those thresholds Rs was controlled by soil moisture. Exponential and linear models adequately described Rs responses to environmental variables during the growing and dry seasons. Models combining abiotic (soil temperature and soil rewetting index) and biotic factors (above-ground biomass index and/or distance from the nearest tree) explained between 39 and 73% of the temporal variability of Rs in the forest and olive grove. However, in the abandoned field, a single variable - either soil temperature (growing season) or rewetting index (dry season) - was sufficient to explain between 51 and 63% of the soil CO2 efflux. The fact that the rewetting index, rather than soil water content, became the major factor controlling soil CO2 efflux rates during the prolonged summer drought emphasizes the need to quantify the effects of rain pulses in estimates of net annual carbon fluxes from soil in Mediterranean ecosystems.",0

Here, we measure soil respiration, water erosion, litterfall and estimate annual changes in C stored in mineral soil, litter and roots, in three representative land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem (late-successional forest, abandoned agricultural field, rain-fed olive grove), and use two C balance approaches (steady-state and non-steady-state) to estimate TBCA. Both TBCA approaches are compared to assess how different C fluxes (outputs and inputs) affect our estimates of TBCA within each land use. InÂ addition, annual net primary productivity is determined and C allocation patterns are examined for each land use. We hypothesized that changes in C stored in mineral soil, litter and roots will be slight compared to soil respiration, but will still have a significant effect on the estimates of TBCA.

Across land uses, more than 60% of the C was allocated belowground. Soil respiration (FS) was the largest component in the TBCA approaches across all land uses. Annual C losses through water erosion were negligible compared to FS (less than 1%) and had little effect on the estimates of TBCA. Annual changes in C stored in the soil, litter layer and roots were low compared to FS (16, 24 and 10% for forest, abandoned agricultural field and olive grove, respectively), but had a significant effect on theÂ estimates of TBCA.

Studies of forest structure and biomass stocks of Neotropical forests are biased toward Amazonian and Central American sites. In particular, standardized estimates of aboveground biomass stocks for the Brazilian Atlantic forest are rarely available. Notwithstanding the role of environmental variables that control the distribution and abundance of biomass in tropical lowland forests has been the subject of considerable research, the effect of short, steep elevational gradients on tropical forest structure and carbon dynamics is not well known. In order to evaluate forest structure and live AGB variation along an elevational gradient (0-1100Â m a.s.l.) of coastal Atlantic Forest in SE Brazil, we carried out a standard census of woody stems =4.8Â cm dbh in 13 1-ha permanent plots established on four different sites in 2006-2007. Live AGB ranged from 166.3Â MgÂ ha-1 (bootstrapped 95% CI: 144.4,187.0) to 283.2Â MgÂ ha-1 (bootstrapped 95% CI: 253.0,325.2) and increased with elevation. We found that local-scale topographic variation associated with elevation influences the distribution of trees >50Â cm dbh and total live AGB. Across all elevations, we found more stems (64-75%) with limited crown illumination but the largest proportion of the live AGB (68-85%) was stored in stems with highly illuminated or fully exposed crowns. Topography, disturbance and associated changes in light and nutrient supply probably control biomass distribution along this short but representative elevational gradient. Our findings also showed that intact Atlantic forest sites stored substantial amounts of carbon aboveground. The live tree AGB of the stands was found to be lower than Central Amazonian forests, but within the range of Neotropical forests, in particular when compared to Central American forests. Our comparative data suggests that differences in live tree AGB among Neotropical forests are probably related to the heterogeneous distribution of large and medium-sized diameter trees within forests and how the live biomass is partitioned among those size classes, in accordance with general trends found by previous studies. In addition, the elevational variation in live AGB stocks suggests a large spatial variability over coastal Atlantic forests in Brazil, clearly indicating that it is important to consider regional differences in biomass stocks for evaluating the role of this threatened tropical biome in the global carbon cycle.",0

The successional stage of the vegetation determines the radiative budget, energy balance partitioning, evapotranspiration and carbon dioxide flux. Here, we synthesize energy balance measurements from across the western boreal zone of North America as a function of stand age following fire. The data are from 22 sites in Alaska, Saskatchewan and Manitoba collected between 1998 and 2004 for a 150-year forest chronosequence. The summertime albedo immediately after a fire is about 0.05, increasing to about 0.12 for a period of about 30 years and then averaging about 0.08 for mature coniferous forests. A mature deciduous (aspen) forest has a higher summer albedo of about 0.16. Wintertime albedo decreases from a high of 0.7 for 5- to 30-year-old forests to about 0.2 for mature forests (deciduous and coniferous). Summer net radiation normalized to incoming solar radiation is lower in successional forests than in more mature forests by about 10%, except for the first 1-3 years after fire. This reduction in net radiative forcing is about 12-24Â WÂ m-2 as a daily average in summer (July). The summertime daily Bowen ratio exceeds 2 immediately after the fire, decreasing to about 0.5 for 15-year-old forests, with a wide range of 0.3-2 for mature forests depending on the forest type and soil water status. The magnitude of these changes is relatively large and may affect local, regional and perhaps global climates. Although fire has always determined stand renewal in these forests, increased future area burned could further alter the radiation balance and energy partitioning, causing a cooling feedback to counteract possible warming from carbon dioxide released by boreal fires.",1

Previous studies have shown this to be largely caused by instrument heating creating an additional heat flux that is not used in density corrections. A set of meteorological conditions where good data could be extracted in cold temperatures was not evident. Annual NEP was evaluated based on estimates that used a heating correction of Burba et al. (2008) or removal of data when air temperature <0Â Â°C, with replacement using a regression function based on soil temperature. The methods agreed within Â±0.5Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1 which is similar to the potential bias that could be caused by density corrections if accounting for energy balance closure at some sites. Annual NEP (Â±0.5Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1) for boreal forest sites that had experienced stand-replacing fire was: a 6-year-old site was losing 0.6, a 15-year-old site was gaining 0.9, and a 27-year-old site was losing 0.8, for 2-3-year averages. It is difficult to reduce the uncertainty in annual NEP estimates at these boreal sites because of the long cold periods.

The static and dynamic soil properties under artificially established eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.), Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa Hartw. ex. Gord.), as well as native live oak (Quercus agrifolia Née), were compared with those of an unstabilized dune. The O and A horizon development occurred under all the vegetated sites with differences in the horizon thickness occurring in response to vegetation type. The organic C in the vegetated sites (40 000 to 80 000 kg C ha?1) was much greater than in the dune (5000 kg C ha?1). The vegetated soils all exhibited severe water repellency in the surface horizons while the dune exhibited none. The oxalate?extractable Fe in the A horizon of the vegetated soils (1.3–2.3 g kg?1) was greater than that in the dune (?0.9 g kg?1) suggesting the formation of organically bound Fe and/or poorly crystalline Fe minerals. Dithionite?citrate?bicarbonate extracts suggest the formation of more crystalline forms of Fe oxides in the vegetated sites. Soil temperatures were lower and less variable in the vegetated sites (isomesic regime) than the dune site (mesic or thermic regime), apparently slowing biological activity and reducing the soil CO2 contents relative to the dune. Total soil respiration in the vegetated soils (350–400 mg CO2 m?2 h?1) was slightly greater than in the dune (300 mg CO2 m?2 h?1), which lacked any appreciable surface litter undergoing decomposition.",0

Here, we present a model that predicts the temperature dependence of the biomass accumulation rate following disturbances in forests. Model predictions are derived based on allometric and biochemical principles that govern plant energetics and are tested using a global database of 91 studies of secondary succession compiled from the literature. The rate of biomass accumulation during secondary succession increases with average growing season temperature as predicted based on the biochemical kinetics of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. In addition, the rate of biomass accumulation is greater in angiosperm-dominated communities than in gymnosperm-dominated ones and greater in plantations than in naturally regenerating stands. By linking the temperature-dependence of photosynthesis to the rate of whole-ecosystem biomass accumulation during secondary succession, our model and results provide one example of how emergent, ecosystem-level rate processes can be predicted based on the kinetics of individual metabolic rate.

In order to test our hypothesis that differential responses of production and respiration to temperature and moisture shape the carbon balance across a range of spatio-temporal scales, we quantified net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and carbon storage across the New Mexico Elevational Gradient, which consists of six eddy-covariance sites representing biomes ranging from desert to subalpine conifer forest. Within sites, hotter and drier conditions were associated with an increasing advantage of respiration relative to production such that daily carbon uptake peaked at intermediate temperatures - with carbon release often occurring on the hottest days - and increased with soil moisture. Across sites, biotic adaptations modified but did not override the dominant effects of climate. Carbon uptake increased with decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation across the elevational gradient; NEE ranged from a source of ~30 g C m-2 yr-1 in the desert grassland to a sink of ~350 g C m-2 yr-1 in the subalpine conifer forest. Total aboveground carbon storage increased dramatically with elevation, ranging from 186 g C m-2 in the desert grassland to 26 600 g C m-2 in the subalpine conifer forest. These results make sense in the context of global patterns in NEE and biomass storage, and support that increasing temperature and decreasing moisture shift the carbon balance of ecosystems in favor of respiration, such that the potential for ecosystems to sequester and store carbon is reduced under hot and/or dry conditions. This implies that projected climate change will trigger a substantial net release of carbon in these New Mexico ecosystems (~3 Gt CO2 statewide by the end of the century), thereby acting as a positive feedback to climate change.

Within very large plots (median size 25 ha), all stems ?1 cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols.

Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS?ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61 °C), changes in precipitation (up to ±30% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8 g N m?2 yr?1 and 3.1 g S m?2 yr?1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88% reduced tree cover within 5 km).

The database covers all forested biogeographic and climate zones, represents forest stands of all ages, and currently includes data collected between 1934 and 2015. We expect that ForC will prove useful for macroecological analyses of forest C cycling, for evaluation of model predictions or remote sensing products, for quantifying the contribution of forests to the global C cycle, and for supporting international efforts to inventory forest carbon and greenhouse gas exchange.

Carbon assimilation continued to occur in the relatively mild winters, though at a slower rate (April, maximum leaf level assimilation (Amax) of 6-9.5Â ÂµmolÂ m-2 leaf s-1), and ecosystem respiration was relatively low (~1.6Â Â±Â 0.1Â gCÂ m-2 day-1). In the growing season, although photosynthetic capacity was large (July, AmaxÂ =Â 16-21Â ÂµmolÂ m-2 leaf s-1), carbon assimilation was constrained by partial stomatal closure to maintain a sustainable water flow through the soil-plant system, and ecosystem respiration was large (3.5Â Â±Â 0.1 and 4.3Â Â±Â 0.1Â gCÂ m-2 day-1 in growing season of 1996 and 1997, respectively) because of high air and soil temperatures. Despite large changes in evaporative demand over just a few days (VPD changing from 0.5 to 3.5Â kPa), the ecosystem water use was remarkably constant in summer (~1.6-1.7Â mm day-1). Such homeostasis is most likely another result of stomatal control. Interannual variations in climate had a large influence on the ecosystem carbon balance. In summer 1997, an El NiÃ±o year, precipitation was more frequent (17 days with 33Â mm of rain) than in summer 1996 (5 days with 5Â mm of rain), and the net ecosystem exchange was substantially lower in July to September 1997 (10Â Â±Â 60Â gCÂ m-2) than during the equivalent period in 1996 (100Â Â±Â 60Â gCÂ m-2). Although temperatures between years were similar, the carbon assimilation in 1997 was offset by increased respiration, probably because soils were more frequently wet, encouraging microbial respiration.",

Measurements were carried out at a managed, even-aged European beech stand (Fagus sylvatica, 70-150 years old), an unmanaged, uneven-aged mixed beech stand in a late stage of development (F. sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplantanus, and other hardwood trees, 0-250 years old), a managed young Norway spruce stand (Picea abies, 50 years old), and an agricultural field growing winter wheat in 2001, and potato in 2002. Large contrasts were found in NEE rates between the land uses of the ecosystems. The managed and unmanaged beech sites had very similar net CO2 uptake rates (~-480 to -500 g C m-2 yr-1). Main differences in seasonal NEE patterns between the beech sites were because of a later leaf emergence and higher maximum leaf area index at the unmanaged beech site, probably as a result of the species mix at the site. In contrast, the spruce stand had a higher CO2 uptake in spring but substantially lower net CO2 uptake in summer than the beech stands. This resulted in a near neutral annual NEE (-4 g C m-2 yr-1), mainly attributable to an ecosystem respiration rate almost twice as high as that of the beech stands, despite slightly lower temperatures, because of the higher elevation. Crops in the agricultural field had high CO2 uptake rates, but growing season length was short compared with the forest ecosystems. Therefore, the agricultural land had low-to-moderate annual net CO2 uptake (-34 to -193 g C m-2), but with annual harvest taken into account it will be a source of CO2 (+97 to +386 g C m-2). The annually changing patchwork of crops will have strong consequences on the regions' seasonal and annual carbon exchange. Thus, not only land use, but also land-use history and site-specific management decisions affect the large-scale carbon balance. ",

Most relevant studies have focused particularly on the quantification of the above-ground coarse wood productivity, and little is known about the carbon fluxes involved in other elements of the NPP, the partitioning of total NPP between its above- and below-ground components and the main environmental drivers of these patterns. In this study we quantify the above- and below-ground NPP of ten Amazonian forests to address two questions: (1) How do Amazonian forests allocate productivity among its above- and below-ground components? (2) How do soil and leaf nutrient status and soil texture affect the productivity of Amazonian forests? Using a standardized methodology to measure the major elements of productivity, we show that NPP varies between 9.3Â±1.3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (meanÂ±standard error), at a white sand plot, and 17.0Â±1.4 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 at a very fertile Terra Preta site, with an overall average of 12.8Â±0.9 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. The studied forests allocate on average 64Â±3% and 36Â±3% of the total NPP to the above- and below-ground components, respectively. The ratio of above-ground and below-ground NPP is almost invariant with total NPP. Litterfall and fine root production both increase with total NPP, while stem production shows no overall trend. Total NPP tends to increase with soil phosphorus and leaf nitrogen status. However, allocation of NPP to below-ground shows no relationship to soil fertility, but appears to decrease with the increase of soil clay content. ",

Although microbes in peat soil play key roles in the emission of greenhouse gases, their characteristics remain unknown. This study was conducted to clarify the effect of land use change (drainage, forest fire and agricultural land use) on the control of gas emission factors with respect to the characteristics of microbes in tropical peat soils. Field observations were carried out in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, from July 2009 to March 2011. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in tropical peat soils were measured in an undrained natural forest, a drained forest, two burned forests and four croplands. A fumigation-extraction method was used to measure the soil microbial biomass to evaluate the relationships among the soluble organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and the CO2 and N2O fluxes in peat soils. Regarding the relationships between weekly precipitation and N2O emission, positive relationships were found in both the forest and cropland soils. However, the slope of the regression line was much higher in the croplands than in the forest soils. The CO2 fluxes in the croplands but not in the forest soils were significantly correlated with both precipitation and N2O fluxes. In contrast, the CO2 fluxes in the forest but not in the croplands were significantly correlated with the MBC and the MBC/SOC ratio. The SOC did not show any relationship with the CO2 fluxes but showed a positive relationship with the MBN and a negative linear relationship with the nitrate (NO3-) concentration. In addition, the MBN showed a negative relationship with most of the probable numbers of ammonium oxidizers. These results indicate that the agricultural land use of tropical peat soils varied the factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions through microbial activities. Therefore, the microbial biomass may be a key factor in controlling CO2 fluxes in forest soils but not in agricultural peat soils. However, precipitation may be a key factor in agricultural peat soils but not in forest soils.",

This site is part of a newly initiated long-term tower flux measurement program over a chronosequence of white pine plantation forests, known as the Turkey Point Flux Station. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) showed a strong dependence on environmental variables such as temperature, light regime, and vapour pressure deficit. In the summer, saturation water deficit exerted a strong control on photosynthetic uptake through decreased bulk surface conductance. There was a linear relationship between monthly carbon uptake and water loss. For each kilogram of water evaporated from the stand, approximately 2.15Â g of carbon was sequestered. Annual NEP was 196Â gÂ CÂ m-2 from June 2002 to May 2003. Annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was 1442Â gÂ CÂ m-2 and annual ecosystem respiration (R) was 1247Â gÂ CÂ m-2. A cross-site comparison of this site with 19 other, planted and natural, temperate conifer forests showed that NEP at the Turkey Point plantation was relatively low compared to other plantation forests of similar age group in Europe and North America. This analysis also showed that GEP and R of plantation forests was significantly higher than that of natural forests. In plantation forests, GEP and NEP linearly decreased with forest age, while R decreased little. Natural stands showed an increase in GEP and R with stand age, except for an old growth stand in western USA. This showed that photosynthesis, rather than respiration, plays a dominant role in net carbon uptake of both plantation and natural forests. In both, plantation and natural, stands there was a weak or no relationship between NEP and annual temperature and precipitation, while annual GEP and R was positively correlated to these environmental variables. The differences in carbon uptake among plantations and between plantation and natural temperate conifer forests were due more to physical and physiological differences among stands (e.g. stand age, tree density, leaf area index, site history, and adopted management practices in case of plantation forests), rather than differences in environmental variables.",

Since July 1999 the exchange of CO2, water, and energy, as well as weather variables, have been measured almost continuously over two forests, 11 km apart, in the Cuieiras reserve near Manaus, Brazil. This paper presents the sites and climatology of the region based upon the new data sets. The landscape consists of plateaus dissected by often waterlogged valleys, and the two sites differ in terms of the relative areas of those two landscape components represented in the tower footprints. The radiation and wind climate was similar to both towers. Generally, both the long-wave and short-wave radiation input was less in the wet than in the dry season. The energy balance closure was imperfect (on average 80%) in both towers, with little variation in energy partitioning between the wet and dry seasons; likely a result of anomalously high rainfall in the 1999 dry season. Fluxes of CO2 also showed little seasonal variation except for a slightly shorter daytime uptake duration and somewhat lower respiratory fluxes in the dry season. The net effect is one of lower daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the dry season. The tower, which has less waterlogged valley areas in its footprint, measured a higher overall CO2 uptake rate. We found that on first sight, NEE is underestimated during calm nights, as was observed in many other tower sites before. However, a closer inspection of the diurnal variation of CO2 storage fluxes and NEE suggests that at least part of the nighttime deficits is recovered from either lateral influx of CO2 from valleys or outgassing of soil storage. Therefore there is a high uncertainty in the magnitude of nocturnal NEE, and consequently preliminary estimates of annual carbon uptake reflecting this range from 1 to 8 T ha-1 y-1, with an even higher upper range for the less waterlogged area. The high uptake rates are clearly unsustainable and call for further investigations into the integral carbon balance of Amazon landscapes. ",

Aims: To compare the full carbon cycle for two 1-ha forest plots that straddle the ecotone between humid forest and dry forest in Amazonia, ca. 100 km from Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Methods: 2.5 years of measurements of the components of net primary production (NPP) and autotrophic respiration were collected. Results: Total NPP was 15.5 Â± 0.89 Mg C ha-1 year-1 at the humid site and 11.27 Â± 0.68 Mg C ha-1 year-1 at the dry site; a total Gross Primary Production (GPP) of 34.14 Â± 2.92 Mg C ha-1 year-1 and 26.88 Â± 2.70 Mg C ha-1 year-1 at the two sites. Carbon use efficiency for both sites was higher than reported for other Amazonian forests (0.45 Â± 0.05 and 0.42 Â± 0.05). Conclusions: Drier soil conditions selected for the dry deciduous tree species which had higher leaf photosynthesis and total GPP. NPP allocation patterns were similar at the two sites, suggesting that in terms of carbon allocation, the dry forests of the southern Amazonia behave as a scaled-down version of wetter humid forests.

New methods of extrapolating night-time respiration to the entire day and filling gaps in eddy-covariance data in semi-arid systems were developed. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in these systems occurs as pulses associated with rainfall events, a pattern not well-represented in current standard gap-filling procedures developed primarily for temperate flux sites. They furthermore do not take into account the decrease in respiration at high soil temperatures. An artificial neural network (ANN) model incorporating these features predicted measured fluxes accurately (MAE 0.42 gC/m2/day), and was able to represent the seasonal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration at the site. The amount of green leaf area (indexed using satellite-derived estimates of fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation fAPAR), and the timing and magnitude of rainfall events, were the two most important predictors used in the ANN model. These drivers were also identified by multiple linear regressions (MLR), with strong interactive effects. The annual integral of the filled NEE data was found to range from -138 to +155 g C/m2/y over the 5 year eddy covariance measurement period. When applied to a 25 year time series of meteorological data, the ANN model predicts an annual mean NEE of 75(Â±105) g C/m2/y. The main correlates of this inter-annual variability were found to be variation in the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), length of the growing season, and number of days in the year when moisture was available in the soil.

When agricultural land was converted to hybrid poplar plantations, soils under hybrid poplar plantations were initially large sources of C losing a total of 8Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1. As cultivation ceased and net primary productivity (and thus litter input) increased, the soil started to become a net C sink by year 2, reaching its pre-plantation level by year 7. At the ecosystem level, hybrid poplar plantations were a source of C in the first 2 years, due to the small contribution of plant biomass and litter relative to soil C loss. Thereafter, the ecosystem acted as a net C sink and reached its pre-plantation level by year 4. We conclude that growing hybrid poplars on rotations longer than 4 years in the study area would create a net C sink and converting agricultural land to fast-growing short-rotation woody crops has the potential for mitigating future climate change.",

The analyses utilized a biochemically based, big-leaf model of tree canopy photosynthesis (Ac), coupled to multiplicative environmental-constraint functions of canopy stomatal conductance (Gc) via environmental measurements, a temperature-dependent model of ecosystem respiration (Reco), and a soil water balance model. Available root zone water storage capacity at the measurement site is limited to about 50 mm for the very stony soil, and annual precipitation is only 660 mm, distributed evenly throughout the year. Accordingly the site is prone to soil moisture deficit throughout the summer. G c and Ac obtained maximum rates early in the growing season when plentiful soil water supply was associated with sufficient quantum irradiance (Qabs), and moderate air saturation deficit (D) and temperature (T). From late spring onwards, soil water deficit and D confined Gc and Ac congruously, which together with the solely temperature dependency of Reco resulted in the pronounced seasonality in FCO2. Reflecting a light-limitation of Ac in the closed canopy, modelled annual carbon (C) uptake was most sensitive to changes in Qabs. However, Qabs did not vary significantly between years, and changes in annual FCO2 were mostly due to variability in summer rainfall and D. Annual C-uptake of the forest was 717 g C m-2 in a near-average rainfall year, exceeding by one third the net uptake in a year with 20% less than average rainfall (515 g C m-2). ",

Nutrient resorption contributed between 35 and 38% of the annual requirements of N, P, and K, but only 9% of Ca and 12% of Mg. Although a higher percentage of annual N requirement was met by resorption, this forest used N less efficiently than a similar forest in southwestern Alberta.",

Given the importance of soil CO2 efflux in the global carbon balance and the important role of soil monoterpene and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil ecology, we aimed to study the effects of the predicted drought on soil CO2, monoterpenes and other VOC exchange rates and their seasonal and interannual variations. We decreased soil water availability in a Mediterranean holm oak forest soil by means of an experimental drought system performed since 1999 to the present. Measurements of soil gas exchange were carried out with IRGA, GC and PTR-MS techniques during two annual campaigns of contrasting precipitation. Soil respiration was twice higher the wet year than the dry year (2.27Â±0.26 and 1.05Â±0.15, respectively), and varied seasonally from 3.76Â±0.85Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in spring, to 0.13Â±0.01Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in summer. These results highlight the strong interannual and interseasonal variation in CO2 efflux in Mediterranean ecosystems. The drought treatment produced a significant soil respiration reduction in drought plots in the wet sampling period. This reduction was even higher in wet springs (43% average reduction). These results show (1) that soil moisture is the main factor driving seasonal and interannual variations in soil respiration and (2) that the response of soil respiration to increased temperature is constrained by soil moisture. The results also show an additional control of soil CO2 efflux by physiology and phenology of trees and animals. Soil monoterpene exchange rates ranged from -0.01 to 0.004Â nmolÂ m-2Â s-1, thus the contribution of this Mediterranean holm oak forest soil to the total monoterpenes atmospheric budget seems to be very low. Responses of individual monoterpenes and VOCs to the drought treatment were different depending on the compound. This suggests that the effect of soil moisture reduction in the monoterpenes and VOC exchange rates seems to be dependent on monoterpene and VOC type. In general, soil monoterpene and other VOC exchange rates were not correlated with soil CO2 efflux. In all cases, only a low proportion of variance was explained by the soil moisture changes, since almost all VOCs increased their emission rates in summer 2005, probably due to the effect of high soil temperature. Results indicate thus that physical and biological processes in soil are controlling soil VOC exchange but further research is needed on how these factors interact to produce the observed VOCs exchange responses.",

Our aim was to predict the response of these gas exchanges to the drought forecasted for the next decades for this region by GCM and ecophysiological models.Annual average soil CO2 exchange rate was 2.27Â±0.27Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1. Annual average leaf CO2 exchange rates were 8Â±1 and 5Â±1Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in Q. ilex and P. latifolia, respectively. Soil respiration rates in control treatments followed a seasonal pattern similar to photosynthetic activity. They reached maximum values in spring and autumn (2.5-3.8Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 soil CO2 emission rates and 7-15Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 net photosynthetic rates) and minimum values (almost 0 for both variables) in summer, showing that soil moisture was the most important factor driving the soil microbial activity and the photosynthetic activity of plants. In autumn, drought treatment strongly decreased net photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance of Q. ilex by 44% and 53%, respectively. Soil respiration was also reduced by 43% under drought treatment in the wet seasons. In summer there were larger soil CO2 emissions in drought plots than in control plots, probably driven by autotrophic (roots) metabolism. The results indicate that leaf and soil CO2 exchange may be strongly reduced (by ca. 44%) by the predicted decreases of soil water availability in the next decades. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these predictions or to find out possible acclimation of those processes.",

We measured RLL in a treatment area from which all potential sources of CO2 except for the leaf litter layer were removed. Capacitance sensors were used to measure LWC. RLL increased immediately after wetting of the leaf litter layer; peak RLL values were observed during or one day after rainfall events and were up to 8.6-fold larger than RLL prior to rainfall. RLL declined to pre-wetting levels within 2-4 day after rainfall events and corresponded to decreasing LWC, indicating that annual RLL is strongly influenced by precipitation. Temporal variation in the observed contribution of RLL to RS varied from nearly zero to 51%. Continuous in situ measurements of LWC and CO2 efflux from leaf litter only, combined with measurements of RS, can provide robust data to clarify the response of RLL to rainfall events and its contribution to total RS.

These alterations of soil moisture may have significant impacts on the spatial heterogeneity of biogeochemical cycles throughout the watershed. To evaluate how landscape position and vegetation heterogeneity affect soil CO2 efflux (FSOIL), we conducted observations across the Weimer Run watershed (373 ha), located near Davis, West Virginia, for three growing seasons with varying precipitation. An apparent soil temperature threshold of 11 Â°C for FSOIL at 12 cm depth was observed in our data, where FSOIL rates greatly increase in variance above this threshold. We therefore focus our analyses of FSOIL on instances in which soil temperature values were above this threshold. Vegetation had the greatest effect on FSOIL rates, with plots beneath shrubs at all elevations, for all years, showing the greatest mean rates of FSOIL (6.07 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1) compared to plots beneath closed-forest canopy (4.69 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1) and plots located in open, forest gap (4.09 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1) plots. During periods of high soil moisture, we find that CO2 efflux rates are constrained, and that maximum efflux rates occur during periods of average to below-average soil water availability. While vegetation was the variable most related to FSOIL, there is also strong interannual variability in fluxes determined by the interaction of annual precipitation and topography. These findings add to the current theoretical constructs related to the interactions of moisture and vegetation in biogeochemical cycles within topographically complex watersheds. ",

In this study, we used radiocarbon (14C) signatures to partition soil respiration in a cool-temperate deciduous forest, using an isotope mass balance approach. Monthly measurements of soil respiration rates and 14C emissions from soil respiration were conducted using a closed chamber method throughout the growing seasons (May-November) in 2007 and 2008. The 14C contents in root-derived CO2 were assumed to be equivalent to those of the CO2 in the atmosphere or CO2 derived from stored carbon in the plant body with a mean residence time of 2.5 years. 14C contents in CO2 efflux from soil organic carbon were calculated using a model based on five soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and mean residence times of these pools. The contributions of CO2 efflux from surface litter to the total soil respiration were directly measured in situ. The seasonal variation clearly differed among the carbon sources. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration increased with the rise in soil temperature in August and September. Conversely, the contribution of root-derived carbon increased in late July and appeared to correlate with vegetation phenology. The annual CO2 flux was calculated using empirical models based on the soil temperature with the phenology index and the daily averaged soil temperature of the site. Based on these results, the contribution rates of CO2 sources to soil respiration were estimated as 35-39% from surface litter, 23-33% from SOC, and 31-39% from root-derived carbon.",

The forest is patchy, made up of mixed coniferous (Douglas fir) and deciduous (beech) plots. The experiment was developed as a part of the EUROFLUX and ECOCRAFT projects. The experimental set-up has been shown to provide reliable flux estimates provided that an adequate frequency correction is applied. A simple footprint model was used in order to separate the contributions to the flux of the conifer and the beech sub-plots. Saturation net ecosystem exchange decreased with increasing air saturation deficit and with decreasing temperature below 15Â°C. Dark respiration and quantum efficiency decreased with decreasing soil water content and, below 15Â°C, with decreasing temperature. These responses explain most of the seasonal behaviour of the CO2 fluxes. Generally, the differences between the beech and the coniferous sub-plots were low during the full vegetation period. The differences were significant in early spring and late autumn when the leaves in the beech sub-plot were not fully developed or senescent. A relation between night CO2 flux (Ne) and temperature was established. During periods of little turbulent mixing at night, there was a considerable scatter in the plot of Ne versus temperature; however, after selection of the data using an appropriate turbulence criterion, a well-defined relationship between Ne and temperature was established. An optimal criterion was found to be u*>0.4-0.5Â mÂ s-1. No clear difference in Ne between the conifer and the beech sub-plots was detected, probably because of bad footprint conditions at night. A first estimate of the annual carbon sequestration was made by summing the half-hourly Ne and filling in the data gaps resulting from system failures or from removal of data that did not fit the quality criteria. It was found to be -0.60Â kgÂ m-2 per year.",

Here, we investigate if successive annual foliar scorching events will result in a large and rapid decline in soil CO2 efflux, similar to that observed in girdling studies. Using the fire-adapted longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) tree species, we experimentally manipulated foliar leaf area and thus, canopy photosynthesis, via foliar scorching over two consecutive growing seasons. We monitored the effect of scorching on soil CO2 efflux and fine root production, mortality, standing crop, and nitrogen (N) and non-structural carbohydrate (i.e. sugar and starch) concentrations. Despite an immediate 80% reduction in foliar leaf area and sap flow rates from the scorch treatment, there was no effect on soil CO2 efflux in either year. Likewise, the cumulative soil CO2 flux after two scorch treatments remained comparable to that of the control treatment, even after assuming a 100% decline in the autotrophic component for the month following the two scorching events. Fine root standing crop was not diminished by scorching because both fine root production and mortality increased commensurately in the scorch treatment. Fine root N and sugar concentrations were not diminished by scorching, but starch concentrations of 5th order roots decreased after the second scorching treatment, presumably because starch was mobilized from larger roots to maintain more metabolically active 1st order roots. The lack of response observed in soil CO2 efflux following successive canopy scorches differs from the response often observed after girdling and suggests that the carbohydrate reserves of longleaf pine trees are sufficient to maintain root metabolism for extended periods even after an extreme canopy perturbation. We propose that tree species in ecosystems that experience frequent disturbance may allocate more carbon to storage than those in less disturbed ecosystems, and as a result are more resilient to disturbances that affect photosynthate supply. Such species should be capable of maintaining belowground autotrophic respiration during periods of minimal or nonexistent carbon assimilation.",

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have often been reported to increase carbon allocation below-ground, particularly to fine root production. However, for trees these responses have primarily been studied in young expanding systems while the evidence for late successional systems that have reached steady state above- and below-ground is very limited. 2. At the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC) experimental site, we assessed whether elevated CO2 affects fine root biomass, fine root expansion and fine root C and N concentration under mature deciduous trees (c. 100 years) exposed to 7 years of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in a typical near-natural central European forest. 3. After 5 and 6 years of CO2 enrichment, both, the soil core and ingrowth core method yielded similar reductions in biomass of c. -30% under elevated CO2 for live fine roots < 1Â mm diameter. In year 7 of the experiment, when fine root biomass was re-assessed at peak season, there was no significant CO2-effect detectable. C and N concentrations in newly produced fine roots remained unaffected by elevated CO2. Soil moisture under CO2-exposed trees was significantly increased during rainless periods. 4. The isotopic label introduced into the system by canopy enrichment with 13C-depleted CO2 allowed us to trace the newly assimilated carbon. After 6 years of growth at 550 ppm CO2, recent fine roots (< 1Â mm, ingrowth cores) of CO2-enriched trees consisted of 51% new carbon, suggesting a rather slow root turnover and/or slow mixing of old and new carbon in these trees. 5. Reduced tree water consumption under elevated CO2 and resultant soil water savings might cause these trees to reduce their fine root investments in a future CO2-enriched atmosphere. 6. Our findings and those from other multi-year experiments indicate that fine root mass in late successional systems may also be unaffected or even suppressed instead of being stimulated by elevated CO2.

At the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC), we examined how 7 years of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) affected soil CO2 dynamics in a ca. 100-year-old mixed deciduous forest. The use of 13C-depleted CO2 for canopy enrichment allowed us to trace the flow of recently fixed C. In the 7th year of growth at ~550 ppm CO2, soil respiratory CO2 consisted of 39% labelled C. During the growing season, soil air CO2 concentration was significantly enhanced under CO2-exposed trees. However, elevated CO2 failed to stimulate cumulative soil respiration (Rs) over the growing season. We found periodic reductions as well as increases in instantaneous rates of Rs in response to elevated CO2, depending on soil temperature and soil volumetric water content (VWC; significant three-way interaction). During wet periods, soil water savings under CO2-enriched trees led to excessive VWC (>45%) that suppressed Rs. Elevated CO2 stimulated Rs only when VWC was =40% and concurrent soil temperature was high (>15 Â°C). Seasonal Q10 estimates of Rs were significantly lower under elevated (Q10=3.30) compared with ambient CO2 (Q10=3.97). However, this effect disappeared when three consecutive sampling dates of extremely high VWC were disregarded. This suggests that elevated CO2 affected Q10 mainly indirectly through changes in VWC. Fine root respiration did not differ significantly between treatments but soil microbial biomass (Cmic) increased by 14% under elevated CO2 (marginally significant). Our findings do not indicate enhanced soil C emissions in such stands under future atmospheric CO2. It remains to be shown whether C losses via leaching of dissolved organic or inorganic C (DOC, DIC) help to balance the C budget in this forest. ",

The secondary forest had significantly higher (pÂ <Â 0.05) soil respiration rate, fine root biomass and soil organic matter than the agroforestry systems in the dry season. However, in the wet season, soil respiration and soil organic matter in the G. arborea dominated agroforestry system were as high as in the secondary forest. Whereas soil respiration was generally higher in the wet than in the dry season, there were no differences in fine root biomass, microbial biomass and soil organic matter between the two seasons. Soil respiration rate correlated positively and significantly with fine root biomass, microbial biomass, and soil organic C in all three sites. The results of this study indicate, to some degree, that different land use management practices have different effects on fine root biomass, microbial biomass and soil organic C which may affect soil respiration as well. Therefore, when introducing agroforestry system, a proper choice of species and management techniques which are similar to natural forest is recommended.",

Previous comparisons of field-based estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees greater than 10 cm diameter within Amazonia have been limited by the paucity of data for western Amazon forests, and the use of site-specific methods to estimate biomass from inventory data. In addition, the role of regional variation in stand-level wood specific gravity has not previously been considered. Using data from 56 mature forest plots across Amazonia, we consider the relative roles of species composition (wood specific gravity) and forest structure (basal area) in determining variation in AGB. Mean stand-level wood specific gravity, on a per stem basis, is 15.8% higher in forests in central and eastern, compared with northwestern Amazonia. This pattern is due to the higher diversity and abundance of taxa with high specific gravity values in central and eastern Amazonia, and the greater diversity and abundance of taxa with low specific gravity values in western Amazonia. For two estimates of AGB derived using different allometric equations, basal area explains 51.7% and 63.4%, and stand-level specific gravity 45.4% and 29.7%, of the total variation in AGB. The variation in specific gravity is important because it determines the regional scale, spatial pattern of AGB. When weighting by specific gravity is included, central and eastern Amazon forests have significantly higher AGB than stands in northwest or southwest Amazonia. The regional-scale pattern of species composition therefore defines a broad gradient of AGB across Amazonia. ",

Total stocks were low compared to other tropical forest sites, whether estimated by line-intercept sampling (24.4Â Â±Â 5.3Â MgÂ ha-1) or by complete inventories within 11 permanent plots (17.7Â Â±Â 2.4Â Mg ha-1). However, annual inputs, estimated from long-term data on tree mortality rates in the same plots, were similar to other studies (3.8Â Â±Â 0.2Â or 2.9Â Â±Â 0.2Â MgÂ ha-1Â year-1, depending on the equation used to estimate biomass). Assuming the CWD pool is at steady state, the turnover time of coarse woody debris is low (4.7Â Â±Â 2.6 or 6.1Â Â±Â 2.6Â years). These results indicate that these sites have not experienced a recent, large-scale disturbance event and emphasise the distinctive, rapid nature of carbon cycling in these western Amazonian forests.",

How tointerpret eddy covariance measurements correctlyremains a major task. At present, net ecosystemCO2 exchange is assessed, by members of themicrometeorological community, as the sum of eddycovariance measurements and the storage of CO2 inthe underlying air. This approach, however, seemsunsatisfactory as numerous investigators are reportingthat it may be causing nocturnal respiration fluxdensities to be underestimated.A new theory was recently published by Lee (1998, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology91: 39-50) for assessing net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange(Ne) over non-ideal terrain. Itincludes a vertical advection term. We apply thisequation over a temperate broadleaved forest growingin undulating terrain. Inclusion of the verticaladvection term yields hourly, daily and annual sums ofnet ecosystem CO2 exchange that are moreecologically correct during the growing season.During the winter dormant period, on the other hand,corrected CO2 flux density measurements of anactively respiring forest were near zero. Thisobservation is unrealistic compared to chambermeasurements and model calculations. Only duringmidday, when the atmosphere is well-mixed, domeasurements of Ne match estimatesbased on model calculations and chamber measurements. On an annual basis, sums of Newithout the advection correction were 40% too large,as compared with computations derived from a validatedand process-based model. With the inclusion of theadvection correction term, we observe convergencebetween measured and calculated values ofNe on hourly, daily and yearly time scales. We cannot, however, conclude that inclusion of aone-dimensional, vertical advection term into thecontinuity equation is sufficient for evaluatingCO2 exchange over tall forests in complexterrain. There is an indication that the neglected term,u(<U+2202> cÂ¯/<U+2202> x), isnon-zero and that CO2 may be leakingfrom the sides of the control volume during the winter. In this circumstance, forest floor CO2 effluxdensities exceed effluxes measured above the canopy.",

On average, the evergreen and deciduous oak woodlands assimilated and respired similar amounts of carbon while using similar amounts of water. These results suggest that evergreen and deciduous woodlands have specific, and similar, ecological costs in mediterranean climates, and that both leaf habits are able to meet these costs. What are the mechanisms behind these findings? Deciduous oaks compensated for having a shorter growing season by attaining a greater capacity to assimilate carbon for a given amount of intercepted solar radiation during the well-watered spring period; at saturating light levels, deciduous oaks gained carbon at six times the rate of evergreen oaks. Otherwise, the two leaf habits experienced similar efficiencies in carbon use (the change in carbon respired per change in carbon assimilated), water use (the change in carbon assimilation per change in water evaporated), and rainfall use (the change in evaporation per change in rainfall). Overall, leaf area index, rather than leaf habit, was the significant factor in determining the absolute magnitude of carbon gained and water lost by each evergreen and deciduous oak woodland over an annual interval; the closed canopies assimilated and respired more carbon and transpired more water than the open canopies. Both deciduous and evergreen mediterranean oaks survive in their seasonally hot/dry, wet/cool native range by ensuring that actual evaporation is less than the supply of water. This feat is accomplished by adjusting the leaf area index to reduce total water loss at the landscape scale, by down-regulating photosynthesis, respiration, and stomatal conductance with progressive seasonal soil water deficits, and by extending their root systems to tap groundwater.

The objective was to isolate the effect of forest stand age on soil edaphic characteristics (temperature, water table and volumetric moisture) and the consequent influence of these characteristics on the GHG fluxes. Fluxes were measured in a chronosequence in Harwood, England, with sites comprising 30- and 20-year-old second rotation forest and a site clearfelled (CF) some 18 months before measurement. Adjoining unforested grassland (UN) acted as a control. Comparisons were made between flux data, soil temperature and moisture data and, at the 30-year-old and CF sites, eddy covariance data for net ecosystem carbon (C) exchange (NEE). The main findings were: firstly, integrated CO2 efflux was the dominant influence on the GHG budget, contributing 93-94% of the total GHG flux across the chronosequence compared with 6-7% from CH4 and N2O combined. Secondly, there were clear links between the trends in edaphic factors as the forest matured, or after clearfelling, and the emission of GHGs. In the chronosequence sites, annual fluxes of CO2 were lower at the 20-year-old (20y) site than at the 30-year-old (30y) and CF sites, with soil temperature the dominant control. CH4 efflux was highest at the CF site, with peak flux 491Â±54.5 Âµg m-2 h-1 and maximum annual flux 18.0Â±1.1 kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1. No consistent uptake of CH4 was noted at any site. A linear relationship was found between log CH4 flux and the closeness of the water table to the soil surface across all sites. N2O efflux was highest in the 30y site, reaching 108Â±38.3 Âµg N2O-N m-2 h-1 (171 Âµg N2O m-2 h-1) in midsummer and a maximum annual flux of 4.7Â±1.2 kg N2O ha-1 yr-1 in 2001. Automatic chamber data showed a positive exponential relationship between N2O flux and soil temperature at this site. The relationship between N2O emission and soil volumetric moisture indicated an optimum moisture content for N2O flux of 40-50% by volume. The relationship between C : N ratio data and integrated N2O flux was consistent with a pattern previously noted across temperate and boreal forest soils. ",

For the three C pools investigated, model simulation provided a regional estimate, while forest inventory, plot, and soil polygon data provided an estimate of the spatial variation. These data were used to examine the variation of the C estimates, in both temporal (e.g. climate change) and spatial (e.g. soil physical characteristics) dimensions. Using the carbon budget model of the Canadian forest sector (CBM-CFS2) the regional average aboveground biomass C was estimated at 43Â MgÂ CÂ ha-2, similar to the estimate from the 1994 Canadian forest inventory (50Â MgÂ CÂ ha-2). Model simulation over the period 1920-1995 elucidated the major role that disturbances (harvest, fire and insects) play in determining the C budget of the region. Decreases in stand replacing disturbances over the period resulted in an accumulation in biomass C.Regional estimates of forest floor C using aggregated plot data, CSOCD (forested area only) data, and CBM-CFS2 simulations were in close agreement, yielding values of 2.9, 3.4 and 3.3Â kgÂ CÂ m-2, respectively. Regional estimates of total soil C using the three methods were more divergent (14.8, 8.3, and 15.6Â kgÂ CÂ m-2, respectively).An exponential relationship between clay content and biomass for mature coniferous stand types was found (r2=0.68), which is reasonable considering that as a site variable, texture affects tree growth through the modification of nutrient and water availability. The relationship was used to predict the range of potential values for biomass C at maturity across the region. Forest inventories of biomass seldom provide enough data across the range of ages and stand types to develop stand growth curves that capture the variation in growth across the landscape. Consequently, growth dynamics must be inferred from a large area to provide enough biomass-to-age data, which results in a loss in the ability to use it to predict C pools and fluxes at a small scale. Using relationships between site factors (such as soil texture) and biomass C provides a means to modify inventory-based biomass-to-age relationships to assess the variation across the region as well as make predictions at a higher spatial resolution. This is relevant where both spatial extent and a finer scale are required, but site-specific biomass-to-age relationships are unavailable.",

Nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization rate and decay pattern varied significantly from species to species. In general, the decay pattern, characterized by using a composite polynomial regression equation, exhibited three distinct phases of decay during litter decomposition-an initial slow decay phase (0.063% weight loss day-1), followed by a rapid decay phase (0.494% weight loss day-1) and a final slow decay phase (0.136% weight loss day-1). The initial chemical composition of the litter affected decomposition rates and patterns. Species like D. sonneriatoides, D. binectariferum, and T. hodgsonii with higher N and P content, lower carbon and lignin content, and lower C:N ratio and lignin:N ratio exhibited relatively faster decomposition rates than the other species, for example M. ferrea, C. indica and A. grandis. A slow decay rate was recorded for species such as M. ferrea, C. indica, and A. grandis. The initial N and P content of litter showed significant positive correlations with decay rates. Carbon and lignin content, lignin:N, and C:N showed significant negative correlations with decay rates. Soil total N and P, and rainfall, soil temperature, and soil moisture had positive correlations with decay rates. The rapid decomposition rates observed in comparison with other different forest litter decay rates confirm that tropical wet evergreen forest species are characterized by faster decomposition rates, indicating a faster rate of organic matter turnover and rapid nutrient cycling.",

Total annual litter fall was similar in primary and secondary forests, and lower in plantations. Leaf fall in primary and secondary forests was negatively associated with rainfall, and was highest in the dry season. Leaf fall in Eucalyptus plantations showed an opposite response, and peaked during the wet season. Decomposition experiments were carried out in the three habitats using 1200 litter bags (1 mm mesh) filled separately with leaves from four different species of tree, including an exotic plantation species (E. urophylla) and trees typical of secondary (Bellucia spp. and Vismia spp.) and primary forests (Bertholettia excelsa). Litter bags were re-weighed at 3-month intervals 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after being placed on the forest floor. A repeated measures General Linear Model showed that litter decomposition was similar in the primary and secondary forest, and slowest in the Eucalyptus plantations. Leaves decomposed, from fastest to slowest, in the following order: E. urophylla > B. excelsa > Vismia spp. > Bellucia spp. There was no significant interaction between leaf species and habitat type.

We analyze 3 years (1996-1998) of eddy-covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements from two contrasting deciduous forest ecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions of central Canada. The two forest stands have similar ages, heights, and leaf area indices but differ in species composition and climate. Mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was similar for the two ecosystems, varying between 0.7 and 2.7 t CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 (boreal) and 0.6 and 2.4 t CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 (temperate). In the boreal ecosystem, interannual differences in NEP were primarily controlled by early spring temperature. The warm spring of 1998 caused early leaf out and increased photosynthesis but had little effect on respiration. In the temperate ecosystem, the same warm spring not only caused early leaf out but also increased respiration and drought stress. The contrasting impact of the warm spring on annual NEP at the two sites illustrates the complexity of interpreting climatic impacts on the forest carbon balance. It also illustrates two competing influences of climate change on NEP: spring warming, which promotes photosynthesis and increases NEP, and increased soil temperature and drought, which promote respiration and reduce photosynthesis, thus reducing NEP. We discuss the need for a consistent data post-processing methodology in ecosystem intercomparisons. We also compare our results with a recent synthesis of data from European forests.",

A robust method is developed to fill gaps in the annual LAI cycle from systematic but sparse measurements using associated radiation and temperature indices. The ratio of the photosynthetically-active radiation reflectance to the shortwave reflectance is shown to have a particularly distinct LAI signature.Optical estimates of the fully-leafed LAI agreed well with measurements from autumn litterfall and showed moderate inter-annual variability for the trembling aspen overstory (mean Â± S.D. of 2.44 Â± 0.30) and the hazelnut understory (1.98 Â± 0.44). Two features of the annual LAI cycle differed among years-the timing of leaf emergence in spring, which varied by up to four weeks, and the fully-leafed value for LAI, which varied between 3.66 and 5.22. The timing of leaf senescence in autumn was nearly constant among years. The seasonal cycles of FNEP and LAI were tightly coupled and the correspondence between their respective inter-annual differences was remarkable, particularly during leaf emergence in spring.

This study analyses 9 years of eddy-covariance data from the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) Southern Old Aspen site in central Saskatchewan, Canada and characterizes the primary climatic controls on evapotranspiration, net ecosystem production (FNEP), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (P) and ecosystem respiration (R). The study period was dominated by two climatic extremes: extreme warm and cool springs, which produced marked contrasts in the canopy duration, and a severe, 3-year drought. Annual FNEP varied among years from 55 to 367 g C m-2 (mean 172, SD 94). Interannual variability in FNEP was controlled primarily by factors that affected the R/P ratio, which varied between 0.74 and 0.96 (mean 0.87, SD 0.06). Canopy duration enhanced P and FNEP with no apparent effect on R. The fraction of annual photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that was absorbed by the canopy foliage varied from 38% in late leaf-emergence years to 51% in early leaf-emergence years. Photosynthetic light-use efficiency (mean 0.0275, SD 0.026 mol C mol-1 photons) was relatively constant during nondrought years but declined with drought intensity to a minimum of 0.0228 mol C mol-1 photons during the most severe drought year. The impact of drought on FNEP varied with drought intensity. Years of mild-to-moderate drought suppressed R while having little effect on P, so that FNEP was enhanced. Years of severe drought suppressed both R and P, causing either little change or a subtle reduction in FNEP. The analysis produced new insights into the dominance of canopy duration as the most important biophysical control on FNEP. The results suggested a simple conceptual model for annual FNEP in boreal deciduous forests. When water is not limiting, annual P is controlled by canopy duration via its influence on absorbed PAR at constant light-use efficiency. Water stress suppresses P, by reducing light-use efficiency, and R, by limiting growth and/or suppressing microbial respiration. The high photosynthetic light-use efficiency showed this site to be a highly productive boreal deciduous forest, with properties similar to many temperate deciduous forests. ",

We hypothesized that greater hydrologic connectivity would increase C inputs to floodplains that would not only stimulate soil C gas emissions but also sequester more C in soils. In an urban Piedmont river (151 km2 watershed) with a floodplain that is dry most of the year, we quantified soil CO2, CH4, and N2O net emissions along gradients of floodplain hydrologic connectivity, identified controls on soil aerobic and anaerobic respiration, and developed a floodplain soil C budget. Sites were chosen along a longitudinal river gradient and across lateral floodplain geomorphic units (levee, backswamp, and toe slope). CO2 emissions decreased downstream in backswamps and toe slopes and were high on the levees. CH4 and N2O fluxes were near zero; however, CH4 emissions were highest in the backswamp. Annual CO2 emissions correlated negatively with soil water-filled pore space and positively with variables related to drier, coarser soil. Conversely, annual CH4 emissions had the opposite pattern of CO2. Spatial variation in aerobic and anaerobic respiration was thus controlled by oxygen availability but was not related to C inputs from sedimentation or vegetation. The annual mean soil CO2 emission rate was 1091 g C m-2 yr-1, the net sedimentation rate was 111 g C m-2 yr-1, and the vegetation production rate was 240 g C m-2 yr-1, with a soil C balance (loss) of -338 g C m-2 yr-1. This floodplain is losing C likely due to long-term drying from watershed urbanization. ",

Based on sampling in 18, 100Â m2 plots, we identified three distinct community associations: a Fitzroya forest at the bottom of the watershed, a mid-slope Pilgerodendron-Tepualia transition zone, and a ridgetop moorland community. The Fitzroya forest was dominated by a cohort of approximately 400 year-old Fitzroya cupressoides trees. Both tree basal area (138Â m2/ha) and total live biomass (656Â MgÂ ha-1) reached a maximum in this vegetation type. The Pilgerodendron-Tepualia forest consisted of smaller, shorter, and younger trees with dominance shared by Pilgerodendron uviferum, Tepualia stipularis, and to a lesser extent, F. cupressoides. Basal area and biomass were half that of the Fitzroya forest (69.5Â m2Â ha-1; 350Â MgÂ ha-1) but tree density was 65% greater. The moorland can best be described as an open community of mosses and cushion plants that included low stature individuals of P. uviferum, F. cupressoides, and T. stipularis. The size and age structure of F. cupressoides in the bottomland forest suggest that the current cohort of adult trees was established following a catastrophic disturbance and that F. cupressoides is unable to regenerate under its own canopy. In contrast, the size structure of the tree populations in the Pilgerodendron-Tepualia zone indicates that all the constituent tree species, except F. cupressoides, are able to reproduce at least at some microsites in the understory. The watershed-level means for live biomass were 306Â MgÂ ha-1 of aboveground tree biomass, 25Â MgÂ ha-1 of large root biomass (diameter ge 1Â cm), and 46Â MgÂ ha-1 of small root biomass (diameter < 1Â cm).",

We studied the landscape-scale distribution of edaphic properties, plant community characteristics, and aboveground biomass (AGB) in secondary tropical dry forests in northwest Costa Rica. We used structural equation modeling to examine conceptual models of relationships among these factors, with data from 84 0.1 ha plots. Stand age and soils explained 33%-60% of the variation in community-weighted mean values of foliar traits including specific leaf area, foliar nitrogen, phosphorus, and d13C. Aboveground biomass ranged from 1.7 to 409 MgÂ·ha-1 among plots between 5 and >100 years old. Stand age alone explained 46% of the variation in AGB among plots, while a model including age, soil pH, traits, and forest type explained 58%. Stand age was the most important variable explaining the distribution of AGB and community characteristics in secondary forests. We speculate that plot size, landscape heterogeneity, disturbance history, and stand dynamics contribute to the unexplained variation in AGB across the landscape.",

The installation of an eddy covariance flux tower on an Old Black Spruce (OBS) site in eastern Canada (EOBS, Quebec) provided a first opportunity to compare and contrast its annual (2004) and seasonal C exchange with two other pre-existing OBS flux sites from different climatic regions located in Saskatchewan [Southern OBS (SOBS)] and Manitoba [Northern OBS (NOBS)]. Although there was a relatively uniform seasonal pattern of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) among sites, EOBS had a lower total annual NEP than the other two sites. This was primarily because warmer soil under a thicker snowpack at EOBS appeared to increase winter C losses and low light suppressed both NEP and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in June. Across sites, greater total annual GEP and ecosystem respiration (R) were associated with greater mean annual air temperatures and an earlier beginning of the growing season. Also, GEP at all three sites showed a stronger relationship with air temperature in spring and early summer compared with later in the growing season, highlighting the importance of springtime conditions to the C budget of these boreal ecosystems. The three sites had different parameter estimates describing the responses of R and GEP at the half hour time scale to near surface temperature and light, respectively. On the other hand, the responses of both R and GEP to temperature at the monthly scale did not differ among sites. These results suggest that a general parameterization could be sufficient at coarse time resolutions to model the response of C exchange to environmental factors of mature black spruce forests from different climatic regions.

During a cooler, wetter year (2004) and a warmer, drier year (2005), we compared carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes over a mature black spruce stand (EOBS) with a site that was harvested in 2000 (HBS00) and that had similar soil parent material, site fertility, climate, and pre-harvest species composition. During the study period, EOBS was C neutral (0-6Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), while HBS00 was a fairly strong C source (119-167Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1). Averaged over both years, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was 101% higher at EOBS compared to HBS00 (636Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 versus 316Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), while ecosystem respiration (R) was 37% higher at EOBS (633Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 versus 462Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1). The mean between-site difference in annual NEP was six times greater than was the mean between-year difference, thus suggesting that the C budget of boreal black spruce forests is much more affected by developmental stage (i.e., stand age) than by between-year climate variability. Relative to the mature site, the harvested site had a more dynamic structure due to plant regrowth that induced greater between- and within-year variability in the response of GEP and R to environmental conditions over the 2-year study period. For example, maximum photosynthetic capacity was stable between years at EOBS (12.5Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1), whereas it increased from 4.7 to 7.3Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 from 2004 to 2005 at HBS00. The photosynthetically active growing season started about a week later and finished a week earlier at HBS00 relative to EOBS. The earlier snowmelt at the harvested site did not promote an earlier start of the growing season at this site compared to the mature site. Although environmental conditions in spring have a significant influence on the annual C budget of mature sites, this does not seem to be the case for disturbed sites where mid-summer conditions are more important to the annual C balance.",

The role of fire as one of the primary natural carbon cycling mechanisms is a key issue in considering global change feedbacks. The savannas of Northern Australia burn regularly and we aimed to determine their annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the impact of fire on productivity. We established a long-term eddy covariance flux tower at Howard Springs, Australia and present here 5 years of data from 2001 to 2005. Fire has direct impacts through emissions but also has indirect effects through the loss of productivity due to reduced functional leaf area index and the carbon costs of rebuilding the canopy. The impact of fire on the canopy latent energy exchange was evident for 40 days while the canopy was rebuilt; however, the carbon balance took approximately 70 days to recover. The annual fire free NEP at Howard Springs was estimated at -4.3 t C ha-1 yr-1 with a range of -3.5 to -5.1 t C ha-1 yr-1 across years. We calculated the average annual indirect fire effect as +0.7 t C ha-1 yr-1 using a neural network model approach and estimated average emissions of fine and coarse fuels as +1.6 t C ha-1 yr-1. This allowed us to calculate a net biome production of -2.0 t C ha-1 yr-1. We then partitioned this remaining sink and suggest that most of this can be accounted for by woody increment (1.2 t C ha-1 yr-1) and shrub encroachment (0.5 t C ha-1 yr-1). Given the consistent sink at this site, even under an almost annual fire regime, there may be management options to increase carbon sequestration by reducing fire frequency. ",

This paper describes the evolution, design, and current status of OzFlux as well as provides an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from all sites within the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and two sites from New Zealand. The response of the Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies except that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70Â %) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had a similar radiation-use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The two New Zealand sites represented extremes in productivity for a moist temperate climate zone, with the grazed dairy farm site having the highest GPP of any OzFlux site (2620Â gCÂ m-2Â yr-1) and the natural raised peat bog site having a very low GPP (820Â gCÂ m-2Â yr-1). The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing, and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux, and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances, including drought, fire, land-use and land-cover change, land management, and climate change, which are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human, and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australasia. ",

Insights about factors controlling soil CO2 efflux are constrained by the challenge of apportioning sources of CO2 between autotrophic tree roots (and mycorrhizal fungi) and heterotrophic microorganisms. In some temperate conifer forests, the reduction in soil CO2 efflux after girdling (phloem removal) has been used to separate these sources. Girdling stops the flow of carbohydrates to the belowground portion of the ecosystem, which should slow respiration by roots and mycorrhizae while heterotrophic respiration should remain constant or be enhanced by the decomposition of newly dead roots. Therefore, the reduction in CO2 efflux after girdling should be a conservative estimate of the belowground flux of C from trees. We tested this approach in two tropical Eucalyptus plantations. Tree canopies remained intact for more than 3Â months after girdling, showing no reduction in light interception. The reduction in soil CO2 efflux averaged 16-24% for the 3-month period after girdling. The reduction in CO2 efflux was similar for plots with oneÂ half of the trees girdled and those with all of the trees girdled. Girdling did not reduce live fine root biomass for at least 5Â months after treatment, indicating that large reserves of carbohydrates in the root systems of Eucalyptus trees maintained the roots and root respiration. Our results suggest that the girdling approach is unlikely to provide useful insights into the contribution of tree roots and heterotrophs to soil CO2 efflux in this type of forest ecosystem.",

Measurements were made at the 39.5-m and 4-m heights using 3-dimensional sonic anemometers (Kaijo-Denki and Solent, respectively) and closed-path gas analysers (LI-COR 6262) with 6-m and 4.7-m long heated sampling tubing, respectively. Continuous measurements were made from early October to mid-November 1993 and from early February to late-September 1994. Soil CO2 flux (respiration) was measured using a LI-COR 6000-09 soil chamber and soil evaporation was measured using Iysimetry. The leaf area index of the aspen and hazelnut understorey reached 1.8 and 3.3, respectively. The maximum daily evapotranspiration (E) rate was 5-6 mm d-1. Following leaf-out the hazelnut and soil accounted for 22% of the forest E. The estimated total E was 403 mm for 1994. About 88% of the precipitation in 1994 was lost as evapotranspiration. During the growing season, the magnitude of half-hourly eddy fluxes of CO2 from the atmosphere into the forest reached 1.2 mg CO2 m-2 s-1 (33 Âµmol C m-2 s-1) during the daytime. Downward eddy fluxes at the 4-m height were observed when the hazelnut was growing rapidly in June and July. Under well-ventilated night-time conditions, the eddy fluxes of CO2 above the aspen and hazelnut, corrected for canopy storage, increased exponentially with soil temperature at the 2-cm depth. Estimates of daytime respiration rates using these relationships agreed well with soil chamber measurements. During the 1994 growing season, the cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was -3.5 t C ha-1 y-1 (a net gain by the system). For 1994, cumulative NEE, ecosystem respiration (R) and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP = R - NEE) were estimated to be -1.3, 8.9 and 10.2 t C ha-1 y-1 respectively. Gross photosynthesis of the hazelnut was 32% of GEP. ",

Carbon-stock change inventory (NEP<U+0394>C ) values were significantly higher (27-32%), when compared to both NEPeco- and -NEE-based estimates. Additional analyses of the data obtained from this study, together with published data, suggest that there was a systematic overestimation of NEP<U+0394>C -based assessments due to unaccounted decomposition processes and uncertainties in the estimation of soil-C stock changes. In contrast, there was no systematic difference between NEPeco and eddy covariance assessments across a wide range of forest types and geographical locations.",

To address this issue, seasonal variations in daily net ecosystem productivity (NEPd) and two main components of this productivity, daily total ecosystem respiration (REd) and daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEPd), were estimated over 2 years at a flux tower site in French Guiana, South America (5 Â°16'54""N, 52 Â°54'44""W). We compared seasonal variations between wet and dry periods and between dry periods of contrasting levels of intensity (i.e. mild vs. severe) during equivalent 93-day periods. During the wet periods, the ecosystem was almost in balance with the atmosphere (storage of 9.0 g C m-2). Seasonal dry periods, regardless of their severity, are associated with higher incident radiation and lower REd combined with reduced soil respiration associated with low soil water availability. During the mild dry period, as is normally the case in this region, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem was 32.7 g C m-2. Severe drought conditions resulted in even lower REd, whereas the photosynthetic activity was only moderately reduced and no change in canopy structure was observed. Thus, the severe dry period was characterized by greater carbon storage (64.6 g C m-2), emphasizing that environmental conditions, such as during a severe drought, modify the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and potentially the resulting carbon balance.

The chronosequence included seven stands that burned between 1870 and 1998; each stand contained separate well-drained and poorly drained areas. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the distribution of WD, by diameter and decay class, in well-drained and poorly drained stands across the chronosequence, (2) measure the evolution of CO2 from WD samples and model the effects of moisture, size and decay on respiration, and (3) model annual WD respiration and compute decay constants for each site. Coarse woody debris biomass ranged from 1.4 Mg ha-1 to 177.6 Mg ha-1, generally declining in the older stands of the chronosequence. More decayed WD had significantly (a = 0.05) higher moisture, lower density, and higher respiration rates than less decayed WD. Moisture and decay class were significant predictors of respiration when moisture was below 43%. Above this level, moisture was not significant, but stand soil drainage was significant, with drier sites having higher WD respiration. Year of burn was not significant in the respiration models. Modeled annual carbon emissions from WD ranged from 0.11 to 1.92 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Modeled annual decay rates, between k = 0.01 and k = 0.06, changed across the age sequence. Thus a single-exponential decay model may not be appropriate for the age sequence. Calculating k directly from wood respiration measurements, as done here, may be useful in allowing examination of year-to-year changes in k. ",

BSP)-dominated sites comprising a boreal forest chronosequence near Thompson, Man., Canada. The sites burned between 1998 and 1850, and each contained separate well- and poorly drained stands. All components of NPP were measured, most for 3 consecutive years. Total NPP was low (50-100 g C m-2 yr-1) immediately after fire, highest 12-20 years after fire (332 and 521 g C m-2 yr-1 in the dry and wet stands, respectively) but 50% lower than this in the oldest stands. Tree NPP was highest 37 years after fire but 16-39% lower in older stands, and was dominated by deciduous seedlings in the young stands and by black spruce trees (>85%) in the older stands. The chronosequence was unreplicated but these results were consistent with 14 secondary sites sampled across the landscape. Bryophytes comprised a large percentage of aboveground NPP in the poorly drained stands, while belowground NPP was 0-40% of total NPP. Interannual NPP variability was greater in the youngest stands, the poorly drained stands, and for understory and detritus production. Net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated using heterotrophic soil and woody debris respiration data from previous studies in this chronosequence, implied that the youngest stands were moderate C sources (roughly, 100 g C m-2 yr-1), the middle-aged stands relatively strong sinks (100-300 g C m-2 yr-1), and the oldest stands about neutral with respect to the atmosphere. The ecosystem approach employed in this study provided realistic estimates of chronosequence NPP and NEP, demonstrated the profound impact of wildfire on forest-atmosphere C exchange, and emphasized the need to account for soil drainage, bryophyte production, and species succession when modeling boreal forest C fluxes.

Average total dry dead above-ground phytomass (including standing trees and stumps) declines from 1 kg/m2 in Tall Bana to 0.2 kg/m2 in Open Bana. An accumulation of dead matter in Low and Open Bana, relative to the above-ground phytomass of living plants, is noted and this contrasts with the general absence of raw humus in the soil.Eighty-two species of woody plants (dbh=1 cm) were recorded on the total plot area (640 m2); 90% of the species are also known to occur in Tall Amazon Caatinga.

To assess the value of both systems for CO2 mitigation, we performed a systematic analysis of the two systems comparing growth rates and potential to store carbon. The increasing involvement of these forest types in carbon trading makes a pertinent issue. We used a meta-analytical approach to evaluate relative rates of aboveground growth (biomass accumulation) in secondary forests and monoculture plantations, controlling for climate and site characteristics. We find a general tendency for aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) to be marginally higher in plantations than secondary forests. Three recorded site factors were significantly associated with ABA, but differed between reforestation types. Plantation growth rates were negatively correlated with precipitation seasonality, while growth rates of secondary forest were positively correlated with surrounding tree cover and negatively correlated with duration of prior land use. It is noteworthy that poor reporting of site history such as prior land-use duration, particularly in monoculture plantations, and a strong bias in studies towards measuring young forest plots obfuscates evaluation of some ecological drivers and long-term processes. We conclude that the difference in ABA between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations is smaller than previously assumed, emphasising the potential of secondary forests for low-cost carbon storage and biomass production, particularly in landscapes with high existing tree cover or highly seasonal rainfall.",

Both throughfall and soil temperature increased with the proportion of beech. Additionally, microbial respiration and biomass in the organic (O) horizons increased sequentially from the pure spruce to the pure beech stand, suggesting that abiotic and biotic factors enhanced the decomposition of litter under beech. Because the spruce litter decomposition rate was low, carbon (C) stocks of the O horizons increased with the proportion of spruce, from 1.6 to 5.1 kg CÂ·m<U+0096>2. The removal of the O horizons decreased soil respiration by 31%<U+0096>45%, indicating a large contribution of the mineral soil and roots to total soil respiration.

We distinguished between temperature and moisture effects by simulation of prolonged soil droughts in a mixed deciduous forest at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Roofs constructed over triplicate 5 x 5 m2 plots excluded throughfall water during the summers of 2001 (168 mm) and 2002 (344 mm), while adjacent control plots received ambient throughfall and the same natural temperature regime. In 2003, throughfall was not excluded to assess the response of SR under natural weather conditions after two prolonged summer droughts. Throughfall exclusion significantly decreased mean SR rate by 53 mg C m-2 h-1 over 84 days in 2001, and by 68 mg C m-2 h-1 over 126 days in 2002, representing 10-30% of annual SR in this forest and 35-75% of annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of C. The differences in SR were best explained by differences in gravimetric water content in the Oi horizon (r2=0.69) and the Oe/Oa horizon (r2=0.60). Volumetric water content of the A horizon was not significantly affected by throughfall exclusion. The radiocarbon signature of soil CO2 efflux and of CO2 respired during incubations of O horizon, A horizon and living roots allowed partitioning of SR into contributions from young C substrate (including RR) and from decomposition of older SOM. RR (root respiration and microbial respiration of young substrates in the rhizosphere) made up 43-71% of the total C respired in the control plots and 41-80% in the exclusion plots, and tended to increase with drought. An exception to this trend was an interesting increase in CO2 efflux of radiocarbon-rich substrates during a period of abundant growth of mushrooms. Our results suggest that prolonged summer droughts decrease primarily heterotrophic respiration in the O horizon, which could cause increases in the storage of soil organic carbon in this forest. However, the C stored during two summers of simulated drought was only partly released as increased respiration during the following summer of natural throughfall. We do not know if this soil C sink during drought is transient or long lasting. In any case, differential decomposition of the O horizon caused by interannual variation of precipitation probably contributes significantly to observed interannual variation of NEE in temperate forests.

The plot is in mature secondary mixed deciduous forest 5 km south of Front Royal, Virginia, USA. The initial plot census enumerated 38 932 free-standing living stems and 29 991 living individuals =1 cm dbh comprising 62 species, 38 genera, and 26 families, along with an additional 1248 dead/missing standing stems, for a total of 40 180 stems. Dominant canopy trees include tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), hickories (Carya spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and black gum (Nyssa sylvatica). Prominent understory components include spicebush (Lindera benzoin), pawpaw (Asimina triloba), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), witchhazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis). Few species predominate numerically on the plot; seven species have >1000 individuals (71.3% of the total). Mean stand density was 1179 living individuals/ha, while mean basal area was 34.1 m2/ha. Of the total plot area, 4 ha have had white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exclusion since 1990. Woody seedling surveys from 2010-2012 in 354 1-m2 plots measured 19 415 seedlings of 47 species, from new germinants up to 1 cm dbh.

Long-term seed data collected from 1986-2011 for Quercus and Carya within the exclosure and two replicate sites are also presented, documenting considerable annual variation in mast production. Dendrochronological data from 492 tree cores suggested the major canopy trees established circa 1900, but scattered trees of several species existed earlier. Large-scale forest dynamics plots employing standardized methodology have a long, rich history in the tropics. Similar plots in the temperate zone have been largely lacking, however. The SCBI plot represents one of the first of its kind in the Smithsonian Global Earth Observatory's recently established network of such plots, complementing its well-known network of tropical forest plots and enabling comparative studies on forest ecology and climate change at the global scale.

Annual soil respiration at control plots, measured by the soda-lime technique, was 371 g Câ€¢m-2-year-1. We used aboveground litter inputs (138 g Câ€¢m-2year-1) and differences in carbon dioxide effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to total soil respiration by live root respiration (33%) and by organic matter derived from aboveground (37%) and belowground (30%) litter. Newly deposited aboveground litter contributed 31% of the carbon dioxide emitted by total aboveground litter. This estimate is consistent with values published in litter decomposition studies. Nearly two thirds of soil respiration in this forest can be attributed to root activity, comparable with a previous study suggesting that live root respiration plus decomposition of root litter contributes 70-80% of total soil respiration across a wide range of forests.",

In the hardwood stand, soil respiration rates increased after N additions in the first year (control: 482.0Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year; high N: 596.5Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year). This increase is attributed to increased productivity in the hardwood stand compared to the pine stand; N additions are hypothesized to have increased either root or microbial activity, or perhaps both. In the second year, however, respiration in the fertilized hardwood plots was not different from the control plot. In the pine stand, annual soil respiration was 21 and 25% lower, respectively, in low N and high N plots than the control (429.9Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year), with further reductions in the second year.Weekly measures of soil respiration during summer 2001 showed that after 13 years of continuous nitrogen fertilization, soil respiration in the high N plots during growing season months was suppressed by 41% in both stands. To investigate the possibility that reduced microbial activity contributed to decreased total soil respiration, we incubated root-free soil and measured CO2 fluxes. The pattern in average respiration for incubated soils was similar to that observed from total soil respiration measured in the field. Laboratory respiration rates from the hardwood high N and pine high N soils were 43 and 64%, respectively, lower than rates from control soils. This indicates that nitrogen additions have reduced microbial activity and thus CO2 production in the field. Declines in forest productivity measured at both sites, as well as substantial tree mortality observed at the high N sites, may also lower root activity and rhizodeposition, and are also likely to reduce microbial decomposition by reducing organic matter available to soil microbes.",

CO2 efflux rates from the foliage, above ground woody tissue and the soil were measured by chamber techniques. Site-specific models obtained from these chamber measurements were then combined with half-hourly measurements of canopy, stem and soil temperature as well as with soil water potential, leaf area and stem sapwood volume data for scaling up component-specific CO2 efflux to ecosystem respiration (R ECO). Integrated over an entire year R ECO was 550Â gÂ CÂ m-2 ground surface area (average of 2008 and 2009) and comprised the following component fluxes: 57Â % from the soil, 10Â % from above ground woody tissue and 33Â % from the foliage. Between year differences in R ECO and its components were <3Â %. R ECO varied markedly throughout an entire year generally following the seasonal trends in temperature during most of the year. During the dry summer, however, R ECO was significantly reduced due to limited soil water availability in the rooting horizon. Thus, in treeline-associated forests under predicted scenarios of increasing aridity in Mediterranean regions, it is likely that there will be a shift in the contribution of CO2 efflux from the soil (R S), the foliage (R F) and above ground woody tissue (R W) to R ECO from predominately below ground to increasingly above ground. Such changes should be taken into account for predicting the response of treeline forests to a changing climate at their upper distribution limit.",

During secondary forest succession, simultaneous changes occur among stand structural attributes, soil properties, and species composition. Most studies classify tree species into categories based on their regeneration requirements. We use a high-resolution secondary forest chronosequence to assign trees to a continuous gradient in species successional status assigned according to their distribution across the chronosequence. Species successional status, not stand age or differences in stand structure or soil properties, was found to be the best predictor of leaf trait variation. Foliar d13C had a significant positive relationship with species successional status, indicating changes in foliar physiology related to growth and competitive strategy, but was not correlated with stand age, whereas soil d13C dynamics were largely constrained by plant species composition. Foliar d15N had a significant negative correlation with both stand age and species successional status, - most likely resulting from a large initial biomass-burning enrichment in soil 15N and 13C and not closure of the nitrogen cycle. Foliar %C was neither correlated with stand age nor species successional status but was found to display significant phylogenetic signal. Results from this study are relevant to understanding the dynamics of tree species growth and competition during forest succession and highlight possibilities of, and potentially confounding signals affecting, the utility of leaf traits to understand community and species dynamics during secondary forest succession.

The biomass data for Brazil, a major site for deforestation, are few and of uncertain accuracy. Recent international agreements, however, require national inventories of sources and sinks for atmospheric greenhouse gases; such inventories will need better estimates of biomass and their uncertainties. To provide additional information on biomass uncertainty and on forest structure in southwestern Amazonia, a region of active deforestation, we measured in 1988 the diameter, bole and canopy heights of 474 trees covering a total of 1 ha (10 000 m2) in the Ecological Station of the Samuel Hydroelectric Reservoir in Rondonia (845'S, 63Â°23'W). Using allometric equations based on destructively sampled trees, we estimated the largest biomass component, standing alive aboveground biomass (SAAB), as 285 Mg (dry weight) ha-1. Fallen trunks and litter were 30 Mg and 10 Mg ha-1, respectively. The sum of these components, 325 Mg ha-1, is an underestimate of the total biomass because the biomass of roots, vines, shrubs, and small trees was not measured. Measurement error of SAAB is Â± 20%, Â± 57 Mg ha-1 about the mean (95% confidence interval), as derived by a Monte Carlo simulation. The SAAB distribution among trees is highly skewed: 3% of the trees contain 50% of the SAAB. For forests of similar distributions, sampling units typically used for biomass estimates (less than 2000 m2) will usually produce biomass estimates significantly different from those of larger units. Based on subsamples of our data, sampling units of 1000 m2 or smaller had at least a 75% chance of being outside the confidence interval of the global mean (228-342 Mg ha-1) derived from Monte Carlo simulation. To improve estimates of SAAB in similar forests a sampling program should focus on emergent and large canopy trees, the dominant contributors to biomass.",

In this study we quantified soil-atmosphere CH4 and CO2 fluxes in the southwest of Burkina Faso from June to September 2005 and from April to September 2006 at four different agricultural fields planted with sorghum (n = 2), cotton, and peanut and at a natural savanna site with termite (Cubitermes fungifaber) mounds. During the rainy season both CH4 uptake and CH4 emission were observed in the savanna, which was on average a CH4 source of 2.79 and 2.28 kg CH4-C ha-1 a-1 in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The crop sites were an average CH4 sink of -0.67 and -0.70 kg CH4-C ha-1 a-1 in the 2 years, without significant seasonal variation. Mean annual soil respiration ranged between 3.86 and 5.82 t CO2-C ha-1 a-1 in the savanna and between 2.50 and 4.51 t CO2-C ha-1 a-1 at the crop sites. CH4 emission from termite mounds was 2 orders of magnitude higher than soil CH4 emissions, whereas termite CO2 emissions were of the same order of magnitude as soil CO2 emissions. Termite CH4 and CO2 release in the savanna contributed 8.8% and 0.4% to the total soil CH4 and CO2 emissions, respectively. At the crop sites, where termite mounds had been almost completely removed because of land use change, termite fluxes were insignificant. Mound density-based upscaling of termite CH4 fluxes resulted in a global termite CH4 source of 0.9 Tg a-1, which corresponds to 0.15% of the total global CH4 budget of 582 Tg a-1, hence significantly lower than those obtained previously by biomass-based calculations. This study emphasizes that land use change, which is of high relevance in this region, has particularly affected soil CH4 fluxes in the past and might still do so in the future. ",

While within-site variations of soil CO2 efflux (up to 1.6 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1) were larger than their diurnal variability (<0.25 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1), spatial variations within a site were smaller than seasonal changes in soil respiration rates (up to 4.4 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1). Highest within-site variability of soil efflux was generally found during the summer months when maximum flux rates of 4-6 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 were reached (coefficient of variation 40%). Soil temperatures (in the Of and Oh layers, and Ah horizon) showed a pronounced seasonal course, in contrast to soil moisture. An exponential equation best described the relationships between soil temperature in the Of layer and soil CO2 efflux (r2 between 0.75 and 0.81). However, an Arrhenius type equation always resulted in lower r2 values (0.52-0.71). The Q10 values ranged between 2.39 (146-year old stand) and 3.22 (87-year old stand), averaging 2.72 for the P. abies stands within the watershed. The removal of litter and organic layers generally affected soil CO2 efflux negatively. In three of the four P. abies stands (47-, 87-, 146-year old stands), soil respiration rates were reduced by 10-20% after removal of the L and Of layer, and by 30-40% after removal of the L and most of the Of and Oh layers. Thus, mineral soil respiration seemed to contribute a major fraction to the total soil CO2 flux (>60%). Trenching shallow fine roots during collar insertion and mechanical inhibition of root in-growth during the following months allowed fine root respiration to be separated from microbial respiration only in times of highest root growth. Microbial respiration seemed to dominate the respiratory CO2 loss from the forest floor (>70%). The comparison of the annual soil CO2 efflux in the 47-year old P. abies stand (about 710 g C m-2 yr-1) with annual litterfall and root net primary productivity estimates supported this conclusion.",

This in turn could decrease soil CO2 efflux. We measured soil respiration during the first, fifth, sixth and eighth years of simulated atmospheric NO3- deposition (3 g N m-2 yr-1) to four sugar maple-dominated northern hardwood forests in Michigan to assess these possibilities. During the first year, soil respiration rates were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the NO3--amended plots. In all subsequent measurement years, soil respiration rates from NO3--amended soils were significantly depressed. Soil temperature and soil matric potential were measured concurrently with soil respiration and used to develop regression relationships for predicting soil respiration rates. Estimates of growing season and annual soil CO2 efflux made using these relationships indicate that these C fluxes were depressed by 15% in the eighth year of chronic NO3- additions. The decrease in soil respiration was not due to reduced C allocation to roots, as root respiration rates, root biomass, and root turnover were not significantly affected by N additions. Aboveground litter also was unchanged by the 8 years of treatment. Of the remaining potential causes for the decline in soil CO2 efflux, reduced microbial respiration appears to be the most likely possibility. Documented reductions in microbial biomass and the activities of extracellular enzymes used for litter degradation on the NO3--amended plots are consistent with this explanation. ",

In this study we aim to evaluate the independent influence of vegetation structure and climate on soil CO2 efflux within cerrado ecosystems.MethodsWe examine the seasonal and diel variation of soil CO2 efflux, including its autotrophic and heterotrophic components, within two adjacent and structurally contrasting woody savannas in central Brazil.Principle resultsWe found no significant difference in the annual soil CO2 efflux between the two stands (p = 0.53) despite a clear disparity in both LAI (p < 0.01) and leaf litterfall (p < 0.01). The mean annual loss of carbon from the soil was 17.32(Â±1.48) Mg C ha-1 of which approximately 63% was accounted for by autotrophic respiration. The relative contribution of autotrophic respiration varied seasonally between 55% in the wet season to 79% of the total soil CO2 efflux in the dry season. Furthermore, seasonal fluctuations of all the soil respiration components were strongly correlated with soil moisture (R 2 = 0.79-0.90, p < 0.01).ConclusionsAcross these two structurally distinct cerrado stands, seasonal variations in rainfall, was the main driver of soil CO2 efflux and its components. Consequently, soil respiration within these ecosystems is likely to be highly sensitive to any changes in seasonal precipitation patterns.",

The process of harvesting merchantable material and preparing a site for planting can lead to a considerable loss of organic matter. Intensively managed stands may experience more frequent disturbance as rotations decrease in length, exposing the stands to conditions that favor decomposition. To better understand the effects of organic matter removal on forest floor CO2 efflux (Sff), we measured Sff quarterly in 2001 in a 10-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation in eastern North Carolina that received different harvest and site preparation treatments. The treatments examined were removal of merchantable bole (OM0) and whole-tree and forest floor removal (OM2). The organic matter removal treatments did not affect soil moisture or soil temperature, the major variables that control seasonal fluctuations in Sff. Mean Sff ranged from 2.23 to 6.63Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and there were no significant differences between the treatments, despite higher lateral root mass in OM0 (1552Â Â±Â 427Â gÂ m-2) versus OM2 (701Â Â±Â 86Â gÂ m-2). In both treatments, Sff did not correlate to root mass directly beneath each measurement chamber. In OM0, Sff had a negative relationship with distance from the nearest tree, while OM2 showed no effect of tree proximity. Whole-tree and forest floor removal during harvest and site preparation did not result in differences in Sff or soil C, 10 years after establishment. Both treatments resulted in a greater quantity of soil C, indicating that the disturbance associated with harvesting enhanced soil C, at least over the short term. We attribute this increase in soil C to rapid decomposition of previous stands root system.",

Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant; estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha-1) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20% higher.",

Across all plots, annual soil respiration was not correlated with aboveground net primary production (R2=0.06, P>0.1) but it was moderately correlated with belowground net primary production (R2=0.46, P<0.001). Despite the wide range in temperature and precipitation regimes experienced by these forests, all exhibited similar soil respiration per unit live fine root biomass, with about 5 g of carbon respired each year per 1 g of fine root carbon (R2=0.45, P<0.001). Annual soil respiration was only weakly correlated with dead carbon pools such as forest floor and mineral soil carbon (R2=0.14 and 0.12, respectively). Trends between soil respiration, production, and root mass among age classes within forest type were inconsistent and do not always reflect cross-site trends. These results are consistent with a growing appreciation that soil respiration is strongly influenced by the supply of carbohydrates to roots and the rhizosphere, and that some regional patterns of soil respiration may depend more on belowground carbon allocation than the abiotic constraints imposed on subsequent metabolism.

Results indicate significant forest type, age, and typeÂ xÂ age interaction effects on annual soil respiration. Average annual soil respiration was 1100-1600, 1500-2100, and 500-900Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1 for mesic spruce, montane Douglas-fir, and semi-arid pine forests respectively.

Once weighted by the age class distribution for each forest type, the variation in annual soil respiration attributable to stand replacing disturbance was 15%(CV). Sensitivity analysis suggests that the regional variation in annual soil respiration is most dependent on summer base rates (i.e. soil respiration normalized to a common temperature) and much less dependent on the site-specific temperature response curves (to which annual rates are relatively insensitive) and soil degree-days (which vary only 10% among plots).",

Assessing patterns of carbon (C) partitioning (C flux as a fraction of GPP) between above- and belowground components is essential to understand mechanisms driving the C budget of these plantations. Better knowledge of fluxes and partitioning to woody and non-woody tissues in response to site characteristics and resource availability could provide opportunities to increase forest productivity. Our study aimed at investigating how C allocation varied within one apparently homogeneous 90 ha stand of Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) in Southeastern Brazil. We assessed annual aboveÂ­ground net primary production (ANPP: stem, leaf, and branch production) and total belowground C flux (TBCF: the sum of root production and respiration and mycorrhizal production and respiration), GPP (computed as the sum of ANPP, TBCF and estimated aboveground respiration) on 12 plots representing the gradient of productivity found within the stand. The spatial heterogeneity of topography and associated soil attributes across the stand likely explained this fertility gradient. Component fluxes of GPP and C partitioning were found to vary among plots. Stem NPP ranged from 554 g C m-2 year-1 on the plot with lowest GPP to 923 g C m-2 year-1 on the plot with highest GPP. Total belowground carbon flux ranged from 497 to 1235 g C m-2 year-1 and showed no relationship with ANPP or GPP. Carbon partitioning to stem NPP increased from 0.19 to 0.23, showing a positive trend of increase with GPP (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.07). Variations in stem wood production across the gradient of productivity observed at our experimental site were a result of the variability in C partitioning to different forest system components.",

The highest CO2 flux occurred in summer, with peaks in September 2003 for tropical cloud forest and grassland sites and in July 2003 and May 2004 for corn-potato-corn rotation. In autumn, soil surface CO2-C flux started to decrease, with the lowest flux occurring in winter. For the entire data set, there was a weak positive correlation between soil surface CO2-C flux and soil temperature (R2Â =Â 0.12, PÂ <Â 0.0001) and a weak negative correlation between soil surface CO2-C flux and air-filled pore space (R2Â =Â 0.17, PÂ <Â 0.0001).

Based on the well-known temperature response of respiration in plant tissue and microbes, R s is often assumed to increase in a warmer climate. Yet, we assume that substrate availability (labile C input) is the dominant influence on R s rather than temperature. We present an analysis of NPP components and concurrent R s in temperate deciduous forests across an elevational gradient in Switzerland corresponding to a 6Â K difference in mean annual temperature and a considerable difference in the length of the growing season (174 vs. 262Â days). The sum of the short-lived NPP fractions (â€œcanopy leaf litter,â€ â€œunderstory litter,â€ and â€œfine root litterâ€) did not differ across this thermal gradient (+6Â % from cold to warm sites, n.s.), irrespective of the fact that estimated annual forest wood production was more than twice as high at low compared to high elevations (largely explained by the length of the growing season). Cumulative annual R s did not differ significantly between elevations (836Â Â±Â 5Â g C m-2 a-1 and 933Â Â±Â 40Â g C m-2 a-1 at cold and warm sites, +12Â %). Annual soil CO2 release thus largely reflected the input of labile C and not temperature, despite the fact that R s showed the well-known short-term temperature response within each site. However, at any given temperature, R s was lower at the warm sites (downregulation). These results caution against assuming strong positive effects of climatic warming on R s, but support a close substrate relatedness of R s.",

However, determining the contributions of root and microbial respiration to SR, and their separate temporal responses to periodic drought and water pulses, remains poorly understood. This study was conducted in a pine forest ecosystem with a Mediterranean-type climate that receives seasonally varying precipitation inputs from both rainfall (in the winter) and fog-drip (primarily in the summer). We used automated SR measurements, radiocarbon SR source partitioning, and a water addition experiment to understand how SR, and its separate root and microbial sources, respond to seasonal and episodic changes in moisture. Seasonal changes in SR were driven by surface soil water content and large changes in root respiration contributions. Superimposed on these seasonal patterns were episodic pulses of precipitation that determined the short-term SR patterns. Warm season precipitation pulses derived from fog-drip, and rainfall following extended dry periods, stimulated the largest SR responses. Microbial respiration dominated these SR responses, increasing within hours, whereas root respiration responded more slowly over days. We conclude that root and microbial respiration sources respond differently in timing and magnitude to both seasonal and episodic moisture inputs. These findings have important implications for the mechanistic representation of SR in models and the response of dry ecosystems to changes in precipitation patterns.",

Because of their large mass and slow decay rates, they may also play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. For these reasons, it is important to understand the dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD) during forest succession. Here, we estimated the biomass of CWD (defined as logs or snags >10Â cm stem diameter) in nine forest stands, both primary and secondary, on Chiloe Island (42Â°S), southern Chile. The stands represented a successional chronosequence following non-catastrophic human disturbance by fire and logging. We characterized logs in terms of their decay class, total carbon content, moisture content, volume, and dry biomass. CWD biomass ranged from 18 to 413Â MgÂ ha-1, with a recently disturbed and old-growth forests having the largest values. Early- and mid-successional stands had the lowest values. Decay classes of logs differed in density, moisture contents and total carbon content. Carbon stored in logs and snags was nearly 10 times higher in old-growth and primary forests than in young-successional forests. CWD biomass is substantially reduced in young growing stands with disrupting effects on ecological functions and biodiversity.",

We find little evidence of this seasonality at a new site in eastern Amazonia, despite the expectation that this site would be particularly sensitive to seasonal fluctuation of rainfall. The average rate of peak net ecosystem exchange was -19 Â± 0.9 (1 S.E.) Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Canopy conductance, evaporation, and vapour pressure deficit were all increased during the dry season, consistent with an increase in bulk temperature and solar radiation. The lack of a dry season decrease in photosynthesis was thought to be due to the observed increase in leaf area following dry season flushing. This was accompanied by an increase in solar radiation, and we suggest that the effect of â€œdrynessâ€ was merely to preclude optimality of photosynthetic response to this increase in radiation. The gross primary productivity of this site was estimated to be 36 t C ha-1 yr-1. This is similar to that reported for other Amazon forest stands. The year may have been a particularly productive one due to the lack of an El Nino event. ",

We investigated these drivers in limestone cedar glades, known for their concentrations of endemic plant species and for seasonal hydrologic extremes (xeric and saturated conditions), and compared our findings to those in temperate grasslands and semi-arid ecosystems.MethodsWe measured R s , soil temperature (T s ), volumetric soil water content (SWC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil depth, and vegetation cover monthly over 16Â mo and analyzed effects of these variables on R s .ResultsSeasonally, R s primarily tracked T s (r2 = 0.77; P < 0.01), however R s was depressed during a summer drought. SOM was highly variable spatially, and incorporating SOM effects into the R s model dramatically improved model performance. Both shallow soil and sparse vegetation cover were also associated with lower R s .ConclusionsSoil depth, SOM, and vegetation cover were important drivers of R s in limestone cedar glades. Seasonal R s patterns reflected those for mesic temperate grasslands more than for semi-arid ecosystems, in that R s primarily tracked temperature for most of the year.",

Soil respiration exhibited pronounced seasonal and spatial variations in the studied forest ecosystem plots. The CO2 flux rates ranged from minimum averages of 2.3Â Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (winter) to maximum averages of about 7Â Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (summer) at all the investigated locations. An empirical model describing the relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature predicted seasonal variations in soil respiration reasonably well during 2006. Nevertheless, there were also some indications that soil moisture in relation to soil texture could influence the soil CO2 efflux rates in both sampling seasons. It was shown that spatial variability of mean soil respiration at the investigated sites was high and strongly related to root biomass. Based on the data, it was shown that new photoassimilates could account for a major part of the total soil respiration under canopy conditions in forest ecosystems where no carbonate rocks are present, indicating that microbial respiration could not always dominate bulk soil CO2 fluxes. At SneÅ¾na jama and Rajhenav, the abiotic CO2 derived from carbonate dissolution had a pronounced influence on CO2 efflux accounting, on average, to ~17%. Further spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration was clearly affected by management practice. Higher respiration rates as well as higher variability in respiration rates were observed in the virgin forest (Rajhenav) than in the management forest (SneÅ¾na jama) and could be related to a higher amount of detritus and consequently to less pronounced influence of inorganic pool to CO2 efflux, lower mixing with atmospheric CO2 and higher sensitivity to environmental changes. Major differences in soil carbon dynamics among these five forest ecosystems can be explained by the influence of bedrock geology (particularly, the presence or absence of carbonate minerals) and soil texture (affecting gas exchange with overlying air and soil moisture).

Fertilization, soil C and N concentration and root N had negligible effects on Rs. Fine root density, but not medium- and large-sized root density, contributed to explaining part of the yearly variability of Rs and proved to be a good predictor in December, when the statistical significance of the regression made it possible to estimate the autotrophic component of Rs as being about 35% of total soil respiration.",

In this paper, the results of 3-year field measurements are reported on the annual soil respiration (R s) from a temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest (Quercus serrata and Carpinus laxiflora) in Korea, and its interannual variations are examined associated with changing precipitation. Based on biweekly chamber measurements from 2001 to 2004, the annual soil CO2 emission averaged to be 7.8Â tÂ CÂ ha-1 with an annual variability of ~20%. The soil temperature explained 22-97% of seasonal variations of R s each year whereas the water-filled porosity (WFP) and precipitation pattern had a major effect on the observed interannual variation. The optimum values of WFP during the main growing season depended not only on the amount but also on the intensity and frequency of precipitation. These results indicate that the changes in catchment hydrology can significantly alter the carbon sink/source strength of forest ecosystems in monsoon Asia.",

Bias in the allometric relationship between trunk base diameter (Db, at 1.3Â m height or above the buttresses) and mass can also lead to systematic errors in ANPP estimates. We developed an unbiased model of the relationship between Db and tree mass using data from 315 trees (=5Â cm Db) harvested in the central Amazon. This model was compared with other theoretical (n=1) and empirical models (n=4). The theoretical model, and one empirical model, made predictions that differed substantially form our central Amazon model. The other three empirical models made predictions that were consistent with our model despite being developed in different tropical forests. Models differed mostly in predicting large tree mass. Using permanent forest inventory plot data, our Db versus tree mass model, and a bole volume model, we estimated that tree damage amounts to 0.9Â MgÂ ha-1 per year (dry mass) of litter production. This damage should be included as a mass loss term when calculating ANPP. Incorporating fine litter data from published studies, we estimated that average ANPP for central Amazon plateau forests is at least 12.9Â MgÂ ha-1 per year (or 6.5Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 per year). Additional sources of error as described in the text can raise this estimate by as much as 4Â MgÂ ha-1 per year.

We measured leaf, live wood, and soil respiration, along with additional environmental factors over a 1-yr period in a Central Amazon terra firme forest. Scaling these fluxes to the ecosystem, and combining our data with results from other studies, we estimated an average total ecosystem respiration (Reco) of 7.8 ÂµmolÂ·m-2Â·s-1. Average estimates (per unit ground area) for leaf, wood, soil, total heterotrophic, and total autotrophic respiration were 2.6, 1.1, 3.2, 5.6, and 2.2 ÂµmolÂ·m-2Â·s-1, respectively. Comparing autotrophic respiration with net primary production (NPP) estimates indicated that only ~30% of carbon assimilated in photosynthesis was used to construct new tissues, with the remaining 70% being respired back to the atmosphere as autotrophic respiration. This low ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUE) differs considerably from the relatively constant CUE of ~0.5 found for temperate forests. Our Reco estimate was comparable to the above-canopy flux (Fac) from eddy covariance during defined sustained high turbulence conditions (when presumably Fac = Reco) of 8.4 (95% ci = 7.5- 9.4). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that ~50% of the nighttime variability in Fac was accounted for by friction velocity (u*, a measure of turbulence) variables. After accounting for u* variability, mean Fac varied significantly with seasonal and daily changes in precipitation. A seasonal increase in precipitation resulted in a decrease in Fac, similar to our soil respiration response to moisture. The effect of daily changes in precipitation was complex: precipitation after a dry period resulted in a large increase in Fac, whereas additional precipitation after a rainy period had little effect. This response was similar to that of surface litter (coarse and fine), where respiration is greatly reduced when moisture is limiting, but increases markedly and quickly saturates with an increase in moisture.

Information about the soil CO2 efflux from these ecosystems is particularly scarce, although they have been shown to have special hydrological regimes which might be important in controlling soil respiration. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure soil respiration rates at the Chi-Lan Mountain forest site. The half-hourly dataset was used for analyzing the controlling factors and mechanisms of soil respiration. A manipulation experiment was conducted in the field by applying 3-fold and 1-fold aboveground litter to the soil surface and measuring the respective soil respiration rates using the static alkali chamber method. The results showed that soil respiration rates have a positive exponential correlation with soil temperature and a negative exponential correlation with soil water content. An empirical model relating soil respiration (Rs) to soil temperature (T) and soil water content (<U+03B8>) is RsÂ =Â -0.095Â +Â e0.88+0.10T-6.99<U+03B8> with R2Â =Â 0.83. The annual soil respiration rate calculated using this model was 176Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1. This extremely low value might be caused by the permanently high soil moisture and the relative lower mean annual temperature compared to other sites that receive similar amounts of precipitation. The 3-fold and 1-fold litter treatments resulted in significantly higher soil CO2 efflux compared to the chambers with no litter. The magnitude of difference diminished to negligible levels 6 months after treatment. About 10% of the annual soil respiration was contributed by the mineralization of fresh aboveground litter. The carbon mass loss of the decomposing litter during the first 6 months was mainly due to leaching of dissolved organic carbon (75%) and secondarily due to mineralization of CO2. From the results of this study, we hypothesized that the TMCFs may be vulnerable to global warming since the drying of the soil may change the soil from being a carbon sink to being a carbon source, thereby releasing soil organic carbon that had been stored for a long period of time.",

Necromass of CWD lying on the ground was also lower in the floodplain (10.3Â Â± 6.1 MgÂ·ha-1, meanÂ Â± 1 SE) than in the clay-rich (30.9Â Â± 5.4) and white sand (45.8Â Â± 7.3) forests (pÂ = 0.001, using the line-intersect method).

These gradients could affect necromass stocks, but this has not yet been tested. This study aims to assess the stocks and determinants of necromass across Amazonian forests. Field-based and literature data were used to find relationships between necromass and possible determinants. Furthermore, a simple model was applied to estimate and extrapolate necromass stocks across terra firma Amazonian forests. In eight northwestern and three northeastern Amazonian permanent plots, volumes of coarse woody debris (=10 cm diameter) were measured in the field and the density of each decay class was estimated. Forest structure and historical mortality data were used to determine the factors controlling necromass. Necromass is greater in forests with low stem mortality rates (northeast) rather than in forests with high stem mortality rates (northwest) (58.5Â±10.6 and 27.3Â±3.2 Mg ha-1, respectively). Using all published necromass values, we find that necromass across terra firma forests in Amazonia is positively related to both forest dynamics (mortality mass inputs and a surrogate for decomposition rate (average wood density of living trees)) and forest structure (biomass), but is better explained by forest dynamics. We propose an improved method to estimate necromass for plots where necromass has not been measured. The estimates, together with other actual measurements of necromass, were scaled-up to project a total Amazonian necromass of 9.6Â±1.0 Pg C. The ratio of necromass (on average weighted by forest region) to coarse aboveground biomass is 0.127. Overall, we find (1) a strong spatial trend in necromass in parallel with other macroecological gradients and (2) that necromass is a substantial component of the carbon pool in the Amazon. ",

A regression model relating the biomass of a tree to its dbh (diameter at breast height) was deduced from previously published data. A power-law allometric relationship of the form AGTB = aDb was used to estimate the tree biomass, AGTB (Mg ha-1), from its dbh D (cm). Using direct measurements of tree biomass in the literature, the best-fit allometric exponent b = 2.42 (SD = 0.02) was found. The logarithm of the coefficient a was normally distributed with an average of -2.00 (SD = 0.27). This method was applied to two permanent research stations of the lowland tropical rain forest of French Guiana: the Nouragues and Piste de Saint-Elie. At the Nouragues, the biomass was estimated from trees 10 cm in diameter on two plots covering a total surface area of 22 ha and yielded an average biomass of 309 Mg ha-1 (Â± 32 Mg ha-1, 95% confidence interval). Spatial variability was also addressed at the Nouragues by estimating the biomass of trees = 30 cm dbh over a total surface area of 82 ha. For the wet tropical forest vegetation type, an average of 284 Mg ha-1 was obtained (spatial variability Â±55 Mg ha-1). Biomass turnover was evaluated at Piste de Saint-Elie from two transects (0.78 and 1 ha) on which all trees =5 cm in diameter were recorded and mapped twice in 10 y. Transect 1 showed a slight increase in biomass, from 245 to 260 Mg ha-1 (338 to 345 Mg ha-1 for transect 2), corresponding to a net increase of 1.9 Mg ha-1 y-1 (0.7 Mg ha-1 y-1), and the biomass ingrowth was 3.2 Mg ha-1 y-1 (2.8 Mg ha-1 y-1).

About 5% of AGB increment was due to trees less than 10Â cm in diameter. 5 To test whether the AGB of tropical forests is increasing due to climate change, we propose that in each forest type, at least 10 hectares of forest be inventoried, and that measurements of the small classes (<Â 10Â cm diameter) as well as large size classes be included. Biomass loss due to crown damage should also be estimated. ",

One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees = 5Â cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.",

This pervasive alteration of mature tropical forests was attributed to global environmental change, such as an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, nutrient deposition, temperature, drought frequency, and/or irradiance. We used standardized, repeated measurements of over 2 million trees in ten large (16-52 ha each) forest plots on three continents to evaluate the generality of these findings across tropical forests. Aboveground biomass increased at seven of our ten plots, significantly so at four plots, and showed a large decrease at a single plot. Carbon accumulation pooled across sites was significant (+0.24 MgC ha-1 y-1, 95% confidence intervals [0.07, 0.39] MgC ha-1 y-1), but lower than reported previously for Amazonia. At three sites for which we had data for multiple census intervals, we found no concerted increase in biomass gain, in conflict with the increased productivity hypothesis. Over all ten plots, the fastest-growing quartile of species gained biomass (+0.33 [0.09, 0.55] % y-1) compared with the tree community as a whole (+0.15 % y-1); however, this significant trend was due to a single plot. Biomass of slow-growing species increased significantly when calculated over all plots (+0.21 [0.02, 0.37] % y-1), and in half of our plots when calculated individually. Our results do not support the hypothesis that fast-growing species are consistently increasing in dominance in tropical tree communities. Instead, they suggest that our plots may be simultaneously recovering from past disturbances and affected by changes in resource availability. More long-term studies are necessary to clarify the contribution of global change to the functioning of tropical forests. ",

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the â€˜leaf economics spectrum', a similar â€˜wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits. ",

Here we draw from a large number of published and unpublished datasets (n=81 sites) to assess the determinants of litterfall variation across South American tropical forests. We show that across old-growth tropical rainforests, litterfall averages 8.61Â±1.91 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (mean Â± standard deviation, in dry mass units). Secondary forests have a lower annual litterfall than old-growth tropical forests with a mean of 8.01Â±3.41 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Annual litterfall shows no significant variation with total annual rainfall, either globally or within forest types. It does not vary consistently with soil type, except in the poorest soils (white sand soils), where litterfall is significantly lower than in other soil types (5.42Â±1.91 Mg ha-1 yr-1). We also study the determinants of litterfall seasonality, and find that it does not depend on annual rainfall or on soil type. However, litterfall seasonality is significantly positively correlated with rainfall seasonality. Finally, we assess how much carbon is stored in reproductive organs relative to photosynthetic organs. Mean leaf fall is 5.74Â±1.83 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (71% of total litterfall). Mean allocation into reproductive organs is 0.69Â±0.40 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (9% of total litterfall). The investment into reproductive organs divided by leaf litterfall increases with soil fertility, suggesting that on poor soils, the allocation to photosynthetic organs is prioritized over that to reproduction.

The annual values (Â± SD) of NEP, GPP and Re were 357 Â± 51, 2124 Â± 125, and 1767 Â± 146 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively, with ranges of 267-410, 1592-2338, and 1642-2071 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively. Spring to early summer (March-June) accounted for more than 80% of annual NEP while late spring to early autumn (May-August) was mainly responsible for its interannual variability (~80%). The major drivers of interannual variability in annual carbon (C) fluxes were annual and spring mean air temperatures (Ta) and water deficiency during late summer and autumn (July-October) when this Douglas-fir forest growth was often water-limited. Photosynthetically active radiation (Q), and the combination of Q and soil water content (<U+03B8>) explained 85% and 91% of the variance of monthly GPP, respectively; and 91% and 96% of the variance of monthly Re was explained by Ta and the combination of Ta and <U+03B8>, respectively. Annual net C sequestration was high during optimally warm and normal precipitation years, but low in unusually warm or severely dry years. Excluding 1998 and 1999, the 2 years strongly affected by an El Nino/La Nina cycle, annual NEP significantly decreased with increasing annual mean Ta. Annual NEP will likely decrease whereas both annual GPP and Re will likely increase if the future climate at the site follows a trend similar to that of the past 40 years. ",

The respiration rates of fine roots (<5Â mm) were significantly higher than those of coarse roots (>5Â mm) for both A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla species. The root respiration of A. crassicarpa showed a clear seasonal pattern with a higher value in the wet season. For E. urophylla, the seasonal pattern was observed for fine roots but not for coarse roots. After determining the biomass of fine roots and coarse roots and their specific rates of respiration at different time points, root respiration at the stand level (Ra) was estimated using a direct up-scaling model. We found that the Ra accounted for 14% and 19% of total soil respiration (Rs) for A. crassicarpa and E. urophylla, respectively. The fine (RTf) and coarse (RTc) root respiration at the stand level accounted for about 47% and 53% of the Ra for A. crassicarpa, and accounted for 58% and 42% for E. urophylla. This suggests that coarse root respiration cannot be ignored when estimating the root respiration at the stand level. Our results showed that the Q10 values were more accurate in representing the temperature dependence when the confounding effect of soil moisture was considered. This study introduces an alternative approach to estimate stand level root respiration, but its reliability is largely dependent on the accuracy of root biomass quantification.",

Daily mean Rs varied from 0.28 to 3.62Â Âµmol CO2 m-2Â s-1. Over this period of record, Rs increased exponentially with rising temperature; a Q10 model with 5-cm soil temperature as the independent variable explained 76% of the variation in half-hourly Rs. The temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q10) varied seasonally, being greater in fall than in spring, suggesting seasonal hysteresis in the Rs-Ts relationship. During the summer months (June-August 2011), when Ts was high and had relatively little day-to-day variation, Rs was hyperbolically related to VWC, increasing with increasing VWC up to a VWC threshold of 0.17Â m3Â m-3, but decreasing with increasing VWC above the threshold. A bivariate Q10-hyperbolical model, which incorporated both Ts and VWC effects, improved the performance of Rs simulation in summer, but not annually. These results indicated that Rs was dominantly controlled by soil temperature over the annual cycle. However, VWC served as the dominant control in summer.

Two approaches were used to estimate the contribution of different C pools to SR. In the first approach, the variations in 14C content of soil CO2 efflux were monitored during one year (2003) and compared to the atmospheric and SOC 14C signatures to determine the contribution of â€œfastâ€ (root respiration and fast decomposing SOC) and â€œslowâ€ cycling C pools to total SR. In the second approach an estimate of the total heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh), comprising the slow cycling C and the heterotrophic part of the fast-cycling C pools, was derived applying a box model based on the amount of the bulk SOC pool and its 14C-derived mean residence time (MRT). The quantification of the Rh and the decomposition rate of the slow-cycling SOC allows to indirectly determining the contribution of the heterotrophic C that decompose within a year. Measurements of total SR performed in the field allowed assessing the contribution of the different C pools to total soil C efflux. On an annual basis, the fast-cycling C was the main contributor to SR, about 85%, while the contribution of the slow-cycling C (with MRT >1Â yr) to total SR was 15%. Total annual Rh was 36% of total SR, which is in the lower range reported for temperate coniferous forests. The comparison of Rh with other estimates for the same site (47-50% of total SR) suggest a possible underestimation of the C flux from the mineral soil. In fact, the â€œvery oldâ€ C contained in the plaggen horizon strongly affects the signature of the mostly young C leaving the soil. In conclusion, our results indicate that the contribution of SOC decomposition to total soil CO2 flux in this forest is less than 40%, and at least half of it comes from organic compounds less than 1Â year old.",

Equations often have been developed using differing methods and applied only to certain species or isolated areas. We previously had compiled and combined (in meta-analysis) available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component dry-weight biomass for US trees. This had resulted in a set of 10 consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for US species, as well as equations for predicting biomass of tree components as proportions of total aboveground biomass. In this update of our published equation database and refinement of our model, we developed equations based on allometric scaling theory, using taxonomic groupings and wood specific gravity as surrogates for scaling parameters that we could not estimate. The new approach resulted in 35 theoretically based generalized equations (13 conifer, 18 hardwood, 4 woodland), compared with the previous empirically grouped 10. For trees from USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) plots, with forest types grouped into conifers and hardwoods, previous and updated equations produced nearly identical estimates that predicted ~20 per cent higher biomass than FIA estimates. Differences were observed between previous and updated equation estimates when comparisons were made using individual FIA forest types.",

During both the summer and winter months at the pine ecosystem, net CO2 exchange in the daytime was a curvilinear function of PPFD, with no significant seasonal differences in slope or intercept. In contrast, net CO2 exchange at the cypress ecosystem was minimal during the daytime in the winter. Net CO2 exchange during the nighttime was an exponential function of air temperature at both sites, with Q10 values of 2.0 and 1.9 for the pine and cypress ecosystems, respectively. Lower nighttime fluxes of CO2 occurred at the cypress ecosystem across the entire temperature range. Both of these relatively sparse canopies stored CO2 during stable atmospheric conditions. Mean maximum net CO2 exchange during the daytime and mean nighttime net CO2 exchange for these ecosystems were highly contrasting, and together resulted in a relatively low rate of annual carbon accumulation in the wetland when compared to the aggrading pine ecosystem.

We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems =10Â cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown's (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the â€˜OTS plots'), another was based on 1170 0.01Â ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the â€˜Vegetation map plots'), and the third was from 18 0.5Â ha plots (the â€˜Carbono plots') sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: flat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; flat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on flat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana life forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35-0.5Â ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of <12% for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186Â Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996).Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of stems, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.",

However, a review of the database commonly used to address these issues shows that it has serious flaws. In this paper we synthesize the data in the primary literature on NPP in old-growth tropical forests to produce a consistent data set on NPP for these forests. Studies in this biome have addressed only a few NPP components, all aboveground. Given the limited scope of the direct field measurements, we sought relationships in the existing data that allow estimation of unmeasured aspects of production from those that are more easily assessed. We found a predictive relationship between annual litterfall and aboveground biomass increment. For 39 diverse tropical forest sites, we then developed consistent, documented estimates of the upper and lower bounds around total NPP to serve as benchmarks for calibrating and validating biogeochemical models with respect to this biome. We developed these estimates based on existing field measurements, current understanding of aboveground consumption and biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions, and our judgment that belowground production is bounded by the range 0.2-1.2 x ANPP (aboveground NPP). Across this broad spectrum of tropical forests (dry to wet, lowland to montane, nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor soils), our estimates of lower and upper bounds on total NPP range from 1.7 to 11.8 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 (lower bounds) and from 3.1 to 21.7 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 (upper bounds). We also showed that two relationships that have been used for estimating NPP (the Bray-Gorham relationship based on leaf litterfall and the Miami model based on temperature or precipitation) are not valid for the tropical forest biome.

Daytime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEEday) at the clearcut was not significantly different than zero during the growing season of the first year following harvest and reached levels that were ~40% of those at the older stands during the second growing season. NEEday was similar at the mid-rotation and rotation-aged sites, reflecting the similar leaf areas of these stands. Nighttime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEEnight) was an exponential function of air or soil temperature at all sites. However, low decomposition rates of litter and flooding of the site following harvest likely constrained NEEnight at the clearcut, and drought affected rates at the mid-rotation site. Annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEEyr) was estimated at -1269 and -882 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at the clearcut, and 576 and 603 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at the mid-rotation stand in 1998 and 1999, respectively. For comparison, NEEyr was 741 and 610 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at the rotation-aged stand in 1996 and 1997, respectively. In contrast, annual ecosystem respiration (Reco) was similar in magnitude at all sites during all years. Although Reco is similar in magnitude, NEEyr is highly dynamic across this intensively managed landscape, with a maximum range of ~2000 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1. This range exceeds that across all the sites in both the Ameriflux and Euroflux networks and illustrates the need to include the range of stand ages and disturbance histories in landscape- to regional-scale flux estimates.

In this study, we used eddy covariance to measure net CO2 exchange with the atmosphere (NEE), and biometric measurements to characterize net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in oak- and pine-dominated forests that were defoliated by Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Three years of data were used to compare C dynamics; 2005 with minimal defoliation, 2006 with partial defoliation of the canopy and understory in a mixed stand, and 2007 with complete defoliation of an oak-dominated stand, and partial defoliation of the mixed and pine-dominated stands. Previous to defoliation in 2005, annual net CO2 exchange (NEEyr) was estimated at -187, -137 and -204 g C m-2 yr-1 at the oak-, mixed-, and pine-dominated stands, respectively. Annual NEP estimated from biometric measurements was 108%, 100%, and 98% of NEEyr in 2005 for the oak-, mixed-, and pine-dominated stands, respectively. Gypsy moth defoliation strongly reduced fluxes in 2006 and 2007 compared with 2005; NEEyr was -122, +103, and -161 g C m-2 yr-1 in 2006, and +293, +129, and -17 g C m-2 yr-1 in 2007 at the oak-, mixed-, and pine-dominated stands, respectively. At the landscape scale, Gypsy moths defoliated 20.2% of upland forests in 2007. We calculated that defoliation in these upland forests reduced NEEyr by 41%, with a 55% reduction in the heavily impacted oak-dominated stands. â€˜Transient' disturbances such as insect defoliation, nonstand replacing wildfires, and prescribed burns are major factors controlling NEE across this landscape, and when integrated over time, may explain much of the patterning of aboveground biomass and forest floor mass in these upland forests.

Long-term compositional and structural changes in secondary stands, 15-63 yr after agricultural abandonment circa 1920, were compared to an adjacent old-growth stand. Later successional trends were projected by computer simulation. The colonizing stand (15 yr) was dominated by Liriodendron tulipifera and Robinia pseudoacacia. Common old-growth species absent at this early stage included Aesculus octandra, Fagus grandifolia, and Tsuga Canadensis. By year 40, Liriodendron dominated the overstory and all old-growth dominants were represented in the understory. After 60 yr, Acer saccharum was clearly the most abundant understory species; gap model projections indicated that after 200 yr it will dominate the forest. The actual old-growth stand was dominated by Acer saccharum. Species richness peaked at mid-succession (Â°50 yr), while diversity (H') and evenness (J') of species biomass were highest at the old-growth stage. Richness peaked with the coexistence of shade-intolerant colonizers in the overstory and shade-tolerants in the understory. Canopy-gap processes of the secondary and old-growth stands differed sharply. The old-growth canopy was composed of large, spreading, and overlapping crowns, while the second-growth stand was composed of narrow, nonoverlapping crowns. Gaps in the secondary stand tended to be small (<100 m2) but numerous. The regeneration of intolerants was low and individual gap microsites were not markedly different from the understory as a whole. Old-growth gaps were often larger, higher light microsites which contrasted sharply with the shaded forest floor. The wider range of gap sizes in old forests accommodates a variety of species, including intolerants, contributing to the high canopy species diversity of old-growth cove forests. ",

In wet tropical forests, drought could stimulate soil respiration via overall reductions in soil anoxia, but previous research suggests that litter decomposition is positively correlated with high rainfall fluxes that move large quantities of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer to the soil surface. Thus, reduced rainfall could also limit C delivery to the soil surface, reducing respiration rates. We conducted a throughfall manipulation experiment to investigate how 25% and 50% reductions in rainfall altered both C movement into soils and the effects of those DOM fluxes on soil respiration rates. In response to the experimental drought, soil respiration rates increased in both the -25% and -50% treatments. Throughfall fluxes were reduced by 26% and 55% in the -25% and -50% treatments, respectively. However, total DOM fluxes leached from the litter did not vary between treatments, because the concentrations of leached DOM reaching the soil surface increased in response to the simulated drought. Annual DOM concentrations averaged 7.7 Â± 0.8, 11.2 Â± 0.9, and 15.8 Â± 1.2 mg C/L in the control, -25%, and -50% plots, respectively, and DOM concentrations were positively correlated with soil respiration rates. A laboratory incubation experiment confirmed the potential importance of DOM concentration on soil respiration rates, suggesting that this mechanism could contribute to the increase in CO2 fluxes observed in the reduced rainfall plots. Across all plots, the data suggested that soil CO2 fluxes were partially regulated by the magnitude and concentration of soluble C delivered to the soil, but also by soil moisture and soil oxygen availability. Together, our data suggest that declines in precipitation in tropical rain forests could drive higher CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere both via increased soil O2 availability and through responses to elevated DOM concentrations.

We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm Âµmol m- 2 s- 1 for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m- 2 s- 1 for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m- 2 year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m- 2 year- 1) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m- 2 year- 1). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m- 2 year- 1. These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal. ",

 primary production (GPP) is partitioned to autotrophic respiration (Ra) and net primary production (NPP), the latter being used to build plant tissues and synthesize non-structural and secondary compounds. Waring et al. (1998; Net primary production of forests: a constant fraction of gross primary production? Tree Physiol 18:129-134) suggested that a NPP:GPP ratio of 0.47 Â± 0.04 (SD) is universal across biomes, tree species and stand ages. Representing NPP in models as a fixed fraction of GPP, they argued, would be both simpler and more accurate than trying to simulate Ra mechanistically. This paper reviews progress in understanding the NPP:GPP ratio in forests during the 20 years since the Waring et al. paper. Research has confirmed the existence of pervasive acclimation mechanisms that tend to stabilize the NPP:GPP ratio and indicates that Ra should not be modelled independently of GPP. Nonetheless, studies indicate that the value of this ratio is influenced by environmental factors, stand age and management. The average NPP:GPP ratio in over 200 studies, representing different biomes, species and forest stand ages, was found to be 0.46, consistent with the central value that Waring et al. proposed but with a much larger standard deviation (Â±0.12) and a total range (0.22-0.79) that is too large to be disregarded.",

In June 2003, cylinders (29.7Â cm diameter) were inserted to 50Â cm soil depth and respiration was measured both outside (control) and inside the trenched areas. The potential problems associated with the trenching treatment, increased decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal mycelia and changed soil moisture conditions, were handled by empirical modelling. The model was calibrated with respiration, moisture and temperature data of 2004 from the trenched plots as a training set. We estimate that over the first 5Â months after the trenching, 45% of respiration from the trenched plots was an artefact of the treatment. Of this, 29% was a water difference effect and 16% resulted from root and mycelia decomposition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration contributed to about 50% each of total soil respiration in the control plots averaged over the two growing seasons. We show that the potential problems with the trenching, decomposing roots and mycelia and soil moisture effects, can be handled by a modelling approach, which is an alternative to the sequential root harvesting technique.",

Mean CO2, water vapor, and temperature profile measurements were used to improve flux estimates during periods of low turbulence, and were effective for friction velocities (u*) >0.3Â mÂ s-1. Unique observations at this site included nighttime and early morning venting anomalies that seemed to originate from a seemingly homogenous area within the forest. These elevated NEE measurements, some as high as 80Â molÂ m-2Â s-1, appeared in valid turbulent flux observations for hours at a time, and provided circumstantial evidence for preferential venting and/or existence of pooled CO2 in low-lying areas. We observed that the forest was a moderate sink for atmospheric carbon, and cumulative NEE of CO2 was estimated to be -334Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 during 2000. Sensitivity to low-turbulence flux corrections was very small (21Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), and discrepancies between annual estimates of NEE and NEP were similar to other sites. A normalized measure of ecosystem respiration, the free energy of activation, was presented and its seasonal variations were analyzed.

In the present study we used an extensive collection of field chamber measurements of soil respiration (Rs) from forest and grassland sites of centre and south of Portugal distributed over a 10 year period. This data were summarized and analysed with the objective to describe seasonal variability of Rs as affected by soil moisture (Hs) and soil temperature (Ts). A Bayesian framework was used to test the effectiveness of soil bioclimatic models in estimating Rs on a daily and monthly time step. Rs seasonality was similar between sites, reaching a maximum in spring and autumn and a minimum in the dry season (July-September). No differences were observed for Rs between sites with different standing biomass or soil carbon stocks either on an annual or seasonal timescale. Hs, and not Ts, was the driving factor of Rs during most of the year. Ts drove Rs response only above certain Hs limits: 10% for forest sites and 15% for grassland sites leading to a Q10 of 2.01, 1.61 and 1.31 for closed forests, open forests and grasslands, respectively. The Bayesian analysis showed that models using Hs as an independent variable performed better than models driven by Ts alone. Monthly estimates of Rs in grasslands can be predicted by simple climatic models based on Hs but none of them was suitable for forest ecosystems, stressing the need for a process-based approach. This study adds to the evidence that Hs controls Rs fluxes for Mediterranean ecosystems and should always be taken into account for extrapolation purposes.",

We manipulated precipitation patterns in a Mediterranean woodland, dominated by Arbutus unedo L., to study the effects of changing precipitation regimes on above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and soil C dynamics, specifically plant-derived C input to soil and soil respiration (SR). Experimental plots were exposed to either a 20 % reduction of throughfall or to water addition targeted at maintaining soil water content above a minimum of 10 % v/v. Treatments were compared to control plots which received ambient precipitation. Enhanced soil moisture during summer months highly stimulated annual stem primary production, litter fall, SR and net annual plant-derived C input to soil which on average increased by 130 %, 26 %, 58 % and 220 %, respectively, as compared to the control. In contrast, the 20 % reduction in throughfall (equivalent to 10 % reduction in precipitation) did not significantly change soil moisture at the site, and therefore did not significantly affect ANPP or SR. We conclude that minor changes (around 10 % reduction) in precipitation amount are not likely to significantly affect ANPP or soil C dynamics in Mediterranean woodlands. However, if summer rain increases, C cycling will significantly accelerate but soil C stocks are not likely to be changed in the short-term. More studies involving modelling of long-term C dynamics are needed to predict if the estimated increases in soil C input under wet conditions is going to be sustained and if labile C is being substituted to stable C, with a negative effect on long-term soil C stocks.

After 3 years, fertilizer treatment had significantly and substantially increased growth in mean height and basal area but there had been no response to irrigation and no interaction between fertilizer and irrigation. Over the four seedlots, trees in fertilized plots were two and a half times taller and had five times more basal area than those in unfertilized plots.More detailed growth estimates of the best seedlot (a first generation seed orchard from Coffs Harbour) showed fertilizer treatment had substantially increased leaf area, stemwood volume and all components of above-ground biomass. After 3 years, fertilizer treatment had increased stemwood mass from 6.9 to 41.4 t ha-1. Mean annual increment in stemwood volume in fertilized plots at age 3 years had reached 34.2 m3 ha-1 year-1, which is the highest growth rate yet reported for any plantation in Australia at such a young age.Above-ground net primary production was directly related to leaf area index and in fertilized plots a productivity of 30 t ha-1 year-1 was associated with a leaf area index of 4.5 at 2 years of age. Tree growth rate in unfertilized plots in this study was severely inhibited by low soil nutrient supply, particularly during the period prior to canopy closure. Higher productivity following application of fertilizer resulted from more rapid expansion of leaf area during the first 12 months while tree crowns were developing, and maintenance of a higher leaf area index thereafter. The possible mechanisms responsible for increased growth and greater leaf area are discussed.",

Secondary species were common in the early stand (1940's), and rapid accumulations of biomass and basal area were measured. Many new species entered the stand, and the number of stems increased. In contrast, the stand of the 1970's approached steady-state for biomass and basal area accumulations, and, relative to earlier measurements, fewer stems and fewer species were recorded in the plot. This apparent dichotomy can be correlated to the periodic disturbance caused by tropical storms. The last severe hurricane to strike Puerto Rico occurred in 1932, 11 years prior to the establishment of the El Verde plot. It is postulated that the early measurements reflect the rapid recovery of the stand following this hurricane, with both invading secondary species and residual primary species present in the stand. Subsequent perturbations (i.e., cutting and another storm) were insufficient to disrupt the unmistakable trend toward a mature forest and the stand quickly approached steady-state conditions.",1

Nearly all models linking forest NPP with soil carbon (C) predict that increased NPP will result in either unchanged or increased soil C storage, and that decreased NPP will result in decreased soil C storage. However, linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage may not be so simple and direct. In an old-growth coniferous forest located in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, we experimentally doubled needle litter inputs, and found that actual soil respiration rates exceeded those expected due to the C added by the extra needles. Here, we estimated that this â€˜priming effect' accounted for 11.5-21.6% of annual CO2 efflux from litter-amended plots, or an additional 137-256Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1 loss of stored C to the atmosphere. Soil priming was seasonal, with greatest amounts occurring in June-August coincident with peaks in temperature and dry summer conditions. As a result of priming, mineral soil was more resistant to further mineralization during laboratory incubations. Soil lignin-derived phenols in the Double Litter plots were more oxidized than in the control, suggesting that the soil residue was more degraded. Our hypothesis that excess dissolved organic C produced from the added litter provided the link between the forest floor and mineral soil and a substrate for soil priming was not supported. Instead, the rhizosphere, and associated mycorrhizal fungi, likely responded directly to the added aboveground litter inputs. Our results revealed that enhanced NPP may lead to accelerated processing of some stored soil C, but that the effects of increased NPP on ecosystem C storage will be based on a net balance among all ecosystem C pools and are likely to be ecosystem-dependant. Forest C models need to include these complex linkages between forest productivity and soil C storage.",

Early successional, ruderal species of vascular plants were prominent for ca. 5 years after clear-cutting, but they occurred as a part of a diverse, species-rich community dominated by more-tolerant species, many of which survived the disturbance of clear-cutting. The rate of accumulation of aboveground biomass averaged 2.2 tâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1 during the first 11 years after clear-cutting, 4.7 tâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1 between 11 and 30 years, and then decreased to 1.5 tâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1 between 30 and 75 years. Foliage biomass recovered to a quantity typical of mature stands within only 3-5 years of disturbance, as a result of the vigorous growth of both ground vegetation and stump sprouts of certain tree species. The patterns of accumulation of N, P, K, and Mg were similar to that of biomass, except that initially their relative rates of accumulation were faster because of the large proportion of nutrient-rich foliage in young stands. The accumulation of Ca was relatively slower, because of its large concentration in tree bark, a tissue whose proportion in the aboveground biomass reached a maximum much later than did foliage.",

To address this need, we quantified the total aboveground biomass (TAGB) and forest structure in 20 intact tropical forest sites in western Brazil. The sites were located in open, dense, and ecotone (to savanna) forest types. The TAGB of open forest ranged from 288 to 346Â MgÂ ha-1, with a mean of 313Â MgÂ ha-1; dense forest TAGB ranged from 298 to 533Â MgÂ ha-1, with a mean of 377Â MgÂ ha-1; and ecotone forests TAGB ranged from 298 to 422Â MgÂ ha-1, with a mean of 350Â MgÂ ha-1. Mean TAGB for all 20 sites was 341Â MgÂ ha-1. â€œlive treesâ€ (broad-leaved trees) comprised most of TAGB, averaging 280Â MgÂ ha-1. Mean aboveground biomass of trees =10Â cm diameter at breast height (dbh) differed between open (239Â MgÂ ha-1) and dense forests (307Â MgÂ ha-1). Mean biomass of live â€œnon-treeâ€ components (predominantly palms) for all 20 sites was 22Â MgÂ ha-1. The combined biomass of coarse wood debris, forest floor (litter/rootmat), and standing dead plants (trees, palms and vines) averaged 38Â MgÂ ha-1 or 12% of the TAGB. Forest structure and biomass distribution were not uniform among sites or forest types. For example, non-tree components ranged from 41% of the TAGB in one ecotone forest to as low as 7% in a dense forest site. Non-tree components comprised 22% of TAGB. This is noteworthy because the non-tree components are often omitted from forest biomass/carbon pool estimates.",

However, temperature sensitivities derived from seasonal changes in SR (from here on denoted seasonal Q10) may not solely reflect the temperature sensitivity of SR, because seasonal changes in SR can also be affected by other seasonally fluctuating conditions and processes. In this manuscript, we present a case study of how the seasonal Q10 of SR can be decoupled from the temperature sensitivity of SR. In a mixed temperate forest, we measured SR under vegetations with different leaf strategies: pure evergreen, pure deciduous, and mixed. Seasonal Q10 was much higher under deciduous than under evergreen canopies. However, at a shorter time scale, both vegetation types exhibited very similar Q10 values, indicating that the large differences in seasonal Q10 do not represent differences in the temperature sensitivity of the soil metabolism. The seasonal Q10 depends strongly on the amplitude of the seasonal changes in SR (SRs), which, under the particular climatic and edaphic conditions of our forest study site, were significantly larger in deciduous forest. In turn, SRs was positively correlated with the seasonal changes in leaf area index (LAIs), a measure of the deciduousness of the vegetation. Thus, in this temperate maritime forest, seasonal Q10 of SR was strongly influenced by the deciduousness of the vegetation. We conclude that the large differences in seasonal Q10 were not entirely due to different temperature sensitivities, but also to different seasonal patterns of plant activity in the evergreen and deciduous plants of this site. Some coniferous forests may be more seasonal than the one we studied, and the deciduous-evergreen differences observed here may not be broadly applicable, but this case study demonstrates that variation of plant phenological process can significantly contribute to the seasonality of SR, and, hence, calculated Q10 values. Where this occurs, the seasonal Q10 value for SR does not accurately represent temperature sensitivity. Because the strong seasonal correlation between SR and temperature does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, Q10 values derived form annual patterns of SR should be used with caution when predicting future responses of SR to climatic change.

The study combined field measurements with soil lab incubations and ends with a modelling framework based on the results obtained. Soil respiration was periodically measured at an oak savanna woodland and a ponderosa pine plantation. Intact soils cores were collected at both ecosystems, including soils with most labile C burnt off, soils with some labile C gone and soils with fresh inputs of labile C. Two treatments, dry-field condition and field capacity, were applied to an incubation that lasted 111 days. Short-term temperature changes were applied to the soils periodically to quantify temperature responses. This was done to prevent confounding results associated with different pools of C that would result by exposing treatments chronically to different temperature regimes. This paper discusses the role of the above-defined environmental factors on the variability of soil C dynamics. At the seasonal scale, temperature and water were, respectively, the main limiting factors controlling soil CO2 efflux for the ponderosa pine and the oak savanna ecosystems. Spatial and seasonal variations in plant activity (root respiration and exudates production) exerted a strong influence over the seasonal and spatial variation of soil metabolic activity. Mean residence times of bulk SOM were significantly lower at the Nitrogen (N)-rich deciduous savanna than at the N-limited evergreen dominated pine ecosystem. At shorter time scales (daily), SOM decomposition was controlled primarily by temperature during wet periods and by the combined effect of water and temperature during dry periods. Secondary control was provided by the presence/absence of plant derived C inputs (exudation). Further analyses of SOM decomposition suggest that factors such as changes in the decomposer community, stress-induced changes in the metabolic activity of decomposers or SOM stabilization patterns remain unresolved, but should also be considered in future SOM decomposition studies. Observations and confounding factors associated with SOM decomposition patterns and its temperature sensitivity are summarized in the modeling framework. ",

In eastern North America, five sites were established in deciduous forests to provide measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) using micro-meteorological methods, and measures of major carbon pools and fluxes, using a combination of forest mensurational, eco-physiological, and other biometric methods. The five study sites, part of the AmeriFlux network, ranged across 10Â° of latitude and 18Â° of longitude, but were all of similar age, canopy height, and stand basal area. Here we present a cross-site synthesis of annual carbon storage estimates, comparing meteorological and biometric approaches, and also comparing biometric estimates based on analyses of autotrophic carbon pools and heterotrophic carbon fluxes (net ecosystem production, NEP) versus those based on measurements of change in two major carbon pools (<U+0394>C). Annual above-ground net primary production (ANPP) varied nearly two-fold among sites and was strongly correlated with average annual temperature and with annual soil nitrogen mineralization (Nmin). Estimates of NEP ranged from 0.7Â MgÂ C per hectare per year in northern lower Michigan to 3.5Â MgÂ C per hectare per year in central Indiana, and were also well correlated with Nmin. There was less variation among sites in estimates of <U+0394>C (range, 1.8-3.2Â MgÂ C per hectare per year). In general, <U+0394>C more closely matched NEE than did NEP, but there was no systematic pattern among sites in over- versus under-estimation of the biometric compared to the meteorologically based measures. Root and soil carbon dynamics were significant sources of uncertainty in our biometric measures and represent a prerequisite area of study needed for accurate estimates of forest carbon storage.",

Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, yet the effects of N deposition on C cycling in these ecosystems are poorly understood. We used a field N-fertilization experiment in lower and upper elevation tropical rain forests in Puerto Rico to explore the responses of above- and belowground C pools to N addition. As expected, tree stem growth and litterfall productivity did not respond to N fertilization in either of these N-rich forests, indicating a lack of N limitation to net primary productivity (NPP). In contrast, soil C concentrations increased significantly with N fertilization in both forests, leading to larger C stocks in fertilized plots. However, different soil C pools responded to N fertilization differently. Labile (low density) soil C fractions and live fine roots declined with fertilization, while mineral-associated soil C increased in both forests. Decreased soil CO2 fluxes in fertilized plots were correlated with smaller labile soil C pools in the lower elevation forest (R2Â =Â 0.65, pÂ <Â 0.05), and with lower live fine root biomass in the upper elevation forest (R2Â =Â 0.90, pÂ <Â 0.05). Our results indicate that soil C storage is sensitive to N deposition in tropical forests, even where plant productivity is not N-limited. The mineral-associated soil C pool has the potential to respond relatively quickly to N additions, and can drive increases in bulk soil C stocks in tropical forests.",

However, there are relatively few ecosystem-scale studies to inform this debate. Aims: We described the carbon cycle in a 1 ha rainforest plot subjected to 8-10 consecutive years of ca. 50% through-fall reduction (TFR) and compare these results with those from a nearby, unmodified control plot in eastern Amazonia. Methods: We quantified the components of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (R a) and heterotrophic respiration, and estimate gross primary productivity (GPP, the sum of NPP and R a) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE, the ratio of NPP/GPP). Results: The TFR forest exhibited slightly lower NPP but slightly higher R a, such that forest CUE was 0.29 Â± 0.04 on the control plot but 0.25 Â± 0.03 on the TFR plot. Compared with four years earlier, TFR plot leaf area index and small tree growth recovered and soil heterotrophic respiration had risen. Conclusions: This analysis tested and extended the key findings of a similar analysis 4 years earlier in the TFR treatment. The results indicated that, while the forest recovered from extended drought in some respects, it maintained higher overall R a relative to the undroughted control, potentially causing the droughted forest to act as a net source of CO2.

Sampling at these locations followed a 4 by 4 replicated experimental design comprised of two atmospheric CO2 concentration levels (ambient [CO2]a, ambientÂ +Â 200Â ppmv, [CO2]e) and two soil nitrogen (N) deposition levels (ambient, ambientÂ +Â fertilization at 11.2Â gNÂ m-2Â year-1). The combination of these measurements permitted indirect estimation of belowground CO2 production and flux profiles in the mineral soil. Adjacent to the soil CO2 profiles, direct (chamber-based) measurements of CO2 fluxes from the soil-litter complex were simultaneously conducted using the automated carbon efflux system. Based on the measured soil CO2 profiles, neither [CO2]e nor N fertilization had a statistically significant effect on seasonal soil CO2, CO2 production, and effluxes from the mineral soil over the study period. Soil moisture and temperature had different effects on CO2 concentration depending on the depth. Variations in CO2 were mostly explained by soil temperature at deeper soil layers, while water content was an important driver at the surface (within the first 10Â cm), where CO2 pulses were induced by rainfall events. The soil effluxes were equal to the CO2 production for most of the time, suggesting that the site reached near steady-state conditions. The fluxes estimated from the CO2 profiles were highly correlated to the direct measurements when the soil was neither very dry nor very wet. This suggests that a better parameterization of the soil CO2 diffusivity is required for these soil moisture extremes.",

At all sites adjacent thinning plots (â€œTâ€) and untreated control plots (â€œCâ€) were established. Measurements at the SW and NE sites covered the years 4-6 after thinning while at the NW site measurements covered the year before and the first 2Â years after thinning. Mean N2O fluxes wereÂ <3Â ÂµgÂ N2O-NÂ m-2Â h-1 at all plots except for the newly thinned NWT plot. CH4 uptake was rather low, too. Very low CH4 oxidation rates during dry periods are explained by physiological drought stress for CH4 oxidizers. Heterotrophic litter decomposition constitutes the largest part of total soil respiration. On the whole, no significant positive or negative effects of the silvicultural treatment on the magnitude of CO2-, CH4- and N2O-trace gas exchange could be observed at the SW site 4-6Â years after thinning. Also at the NE site, no effects of thinning on CO2 and N2O fluxes could be demonstrated. However, at this site a significant moisture-induced lower CH4 uptake could be shown. At the NW site forest management led to a dramatic increase in N2O emissions in the first two summers after thinning and to distinct effects on CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake in the first year after the felling. The unambiguous effects of thinning at the NW site are mainly related to higher C input by dead residues leading to enhanced mineralization activity, to a shift in the competition for nutrients favoring microorganisms as compared to trees and to changes in the soil water availability at the thinned plot. Considering the data obtained from the NE and SW site we expect that with the development of an understorey vegetation at the NW site the observed effects on the magnitude of trace gas exchange due to thinning will continue to decline in the following years. Our results implicate that it is indispensable to take account of the effects of forest management in order to accurately calculate trace gas emission inventories for the investigated forest ecosystem in case thinning took place immediately before.",

In a literature review of mature forests worldwide, Raich and Nadelhoffer (1989) suggested that total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) could be estimated from the difference between annual rates of soil respiration and aboveground litterfall. Here we analyze new measurements of soil respiration and litterfall, including data from the Ameriflux network. Our results generally agree with Raich and Nadelhoffer's previous work. A regression analysis of data from mature forests produced the following relationship: annual soil respiration=287+2.80xannual litterfall. This regression slope indicates that, on average, soil respiration is roughly three times aboveground litterfall-C, which further implies that TBCA is roughly twice annual aboveground litterfall-C. These inferences are based on the uncertain assumption of soil C stocks being at steady state. Nevertheless, changes in soil C would have to be very large to modify the conclusion that TBCA is generally much larger than litterfall. Among only mature temperate hardwood forests, however, the correlation between litterfall and soil respiration was poor, and the correlation among years for a single site was also poor. Therefore, the regression cannot be relied upon to provide accurate estimates of soil respiration or TBCA for individual sites. Moreover, interannual variation in TBCA, short-term changes in C stocks, or different temporal scales controlling leaf litter production and soil respiration may cause important deviations from the global average. The regression slope for data from young forests is steeper, possibly indicating proportionally greater TBCA, but the steady-state assumption is more problematic for young forests. This method for estimating TBCA may be most appropriate where interannual variation is averaged over several years of observations and where a near-steady-state assumption of soil, litter, and root C stocks is least problematic.",

Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P treatments. The plants took up about 10% of the 50 kg P/ha of the first year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20% of the 100 kg N/ha of the first year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.",

Soil respiration (Rs) typically contributes 30-80% of annual total ecosystem respiration (Reco) in forests, but the temporal variation of these ratios across seasons has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate seasonal variation in the Rs/Reco ratio in a mature forest dominated by conifers at Howland, ME, USA. We used chamber measurements of Rs and tower-based eddy covariance measurements of Reco. The Rs/Reco ratio reached a minimum of about 0.45 in the early spring, gradually increased through the late spring and early summer, leveled off at about 0.65 for the summer, and then increased again to about 0.8 in the autumn. A spring pulse of aboveground respiration presumably causes the springtime minimum in this ratio. Soil respiration â€˜catches up' as the soils warm and as root growth presumably accelerates in the late spring, causing the Rs/Reco ratios to increase. The summertime plateau of Rs/Reco ratios is consistent with summer drought suppressing Rs that would otherwise be increasing, based on increasing soil temperature alone, thus causing the Rs/Reco ratios to not increase as soils continue to warm. Declining air temperatures and litter fall apparently contribute to increased Rs/Reco ratios in the autumn. Differences in phenology of growth of aboveground and belowground plant tissues, mobilization and use of stored substrates within woody plants, seasonal variation in photosynthate and litter substrates, and lags between temperature changes of air and soil contribute to a distinct seasonal pattern of Rs/Reco ratios.

Several studies have demonstrated that wetting and drying of the organic horizon contributes to temporal variation in summertime soil CO2 efflux in forests, but this contribution is difficult to quantify. The objectives of this study were to partition CO2 production vertically in a mixed hardwood stand of the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA, and then to use that partitioning to evaluate how the relative contributions of CO2 production by genetic soil horizon vary seasonally and interannually. We measured surface CO2 efflux and vertical soil profiles of CO2 concentration, temperature, water content, and soil physical characteristics. These data were applied to a model of effective diffusivity to estimate CO2 flux at the top of each genetic soil horizon and the production within each horizon. A sensitivity analysis revealed sources of uncertainty when applying a diffusivity model to a rocky soil with large spatial heterogeneity, especially estimates of bulk density and volumetric water content and matching measurements of profiles and surface fluxes. We conservatively estimate that the O horizon contributed 40-48% of the total annual soil CO2 efflux. Although the temperature sensitivity of CO2 production varied across soil horizons, the partitioning of CO2 production by horizon did not improve the overall prediction of surface CO2 effluxes based on temperature functions. However, vertical partitioning revealed that water content covaried with CO2 production only in the O horizon. Large interannual variations in estimates of O horizon CO2 production indicate that this layer could be an important transient interannual source or sink of ecosystem C. ",

Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climate. Here, we report the final results of a 5-year, large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment, followed by 1 year of recovery with natural throughfall, conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions in four out of five treatment years (a natural drought year being the exception), and then recovered during the first year after the drought treatment stopped. Similarly, consumption of atmospheric CH4 increased under drought treatment, except during a natural drought year, and it also recovered to pretreatment values during the first year that natural throughfall was permitted back on the plot. No treatment effect was detected for NO emissions during the first 3 treatment years, but NO emissions increased in the fourth year under the extremely dry conditions of the exclusion plot during a natural drought. Surprisingly, there was no treatment effect on soil CO2 efflux in any year. The drought treatment provoked significant tree mortality and reduced the allocation of C to stems, but allocation of C to foliage and roots were less affected. Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant effect of throughfall exclusion on soil processes during this 6-year period was on soil aeration conditions that transiently affected CH4, N2O, and NO production and consumption.

C storage and distribution in stemwood, coarse woody debris, forest (floorlitter(L)+fermentation/humus(FH)-layers) and upper (0-0.1Â m) mineral soil were measured along a stand development sequence in montane zone mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest in the Craigieburn Range, central South Island. C storage in all pools peaked in 125-year-old pole stands (219Â Mg/ha) and declined as the stands matured (>150 years old, 192Â Mg/ha), and were replaced by seedling stands (10 years old, 152Â Mg/ha) following windthrow, to reach a low point (114Â Mg/ha) in 25-year-old sapling stands. Coarse woody debris provided an important pool for C storage following catastrophic forest disturbance, and varied reciprocally with stemwood along the development sequence. Above-ground components showed a much greater range (88Â Mg/ha) with stand development than forest floor and mineral soil components (16Â Mg/ha). Stemwood and coarse woody debris components varied by 136 and 76Â Mg/ha, respectively, while litter, the FH-layer and upper mineral soil C varied by 4, 17, and 12Â Mg/ha, respectively. The sum of forest floor and mineral soil C ranged between 53Â Mg/ha (sapling stage) and 69Â Mg/ha (pole stage), and did not differ significantly with age.The litter and FH-layers, and mineral soil were re-sampled after a period of 8 years in the sapling and pole stands. C storage in the litter layers did not change significantly over this period. C storage in the FH-layer declined significantly by 9.7Â Mg/ha in the pole stage, but showed little change in the sapling stage. It is hypothesised that C loss resulting from ongoing decomposition in the FH-layer was balanced by continuing inputs of coarse woody debris in the sapling stage, but not in the pole stage, where the coarse woody debris resource was relatively small. There was no change in mineral soil C storage over the 8-year period. It is concluded that, in the absence of disturbance, C storage in the forest floor may vary substantially over periods of <10 years, in contrast to the mineral soil where it appears relatively stable over decadal time intervals.",

The methodology for determining NEE from eddy-covariance flux measurements at 30, 122 and 396 m above the ground, and from CO2 mixing ratio measurements at 11, 30, 76, 122, 244 and 396 m is described. The annual cycle of CO2 mixing ratio in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is also discussed, and the influences of local NEE and large-scale advection are estimated. During 1997 gross ecosystem productivity (947-18 g C m-2 yr-1), approximately balanced total ecosystem respiration (963Â±19 g C m-2 yr-1), and NEE of CO2 was close to zero (16Â±19 g C m-2 yr-1 emitted into the atmosphere). The error bars represent the standard error of the cumulative daily NEE values. Systematic errors are also assessed. The identified systematic uncertainties in NEE of CO2 are less than 60 g C m-2 yr-1. The seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2 was highly correlated with leaf-out and leaf-fall, and soil thaw and freeze, and was similar to purely deciduous forest sites. The mean daily NEE of CO2 during the growing season (June through August) was -1.3 g C m-2 day-1, smaller than has been reported for other deciduous forest sites. NEE of water vapor largely followed the seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2, with a lag in the spring when water vapor fluxes increased before CO2 uptake. In general, the Bowen ratios were high during the dormant seasons and low during the growing season. Evapotranspiration normalized by potential evapotranspiration showed the opposite pattern. The seasonal course of the CO2 mixing ratio in the ABL at the tower led the seasonal pattern of NEE of CO2 in time: in spring, CO2 mixing ratios began to decrease prior to the onset of daily net uptake of CO2 by the forest, and in fall mixing ratios began to increase before the forest became a net source for CO2 to the atmosphere. Transport as well as local NEE of CO2 are shown to be important components of the ABL CO2 budget at all times of the year. ",

We present new data and synthesize plant and soil results from the entire experimental period. Light-saturated photosynthesis (A max) of ca. 35-year-old Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata was stimulated by elevated CO2 throughout the experiment. Slight down-regulation of photosynthesis in Pinus was consistent with starch accumulation in needle tissue. Above-ground growth responses differed between tree species, with a 33Â % mean annual stimulation in Larix but no response in Pinus. Species-specific CO2 responses also occurred for abundant dwarf shrub species in the understorey, where Vaccinium myrtillus showed a sustained shoot growth enhancement (+11Â %) that was not apparent for Vaccinium gaultherioides or Empetrum hermaphroditum. Below ground, CO2 enrichment did not stimulate fine root or mycorrhizal mycelium growth, but increased CO2 effluxes from the soil (+24Â %) indicated that enhanced C assimilation was partially offset by greater respiratory losses. The dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration in soil solutions was consistently higher under elevated CO2 (+14Â %), suggesting accelerated soil organic matter turnover. CO2 enrichment hardly affected the C-N balance in plants and soil, with unaltered soil total or mineral N concentrations and little impact on plant leaf N concentration or the stable N isotope ratio. Sustained differences in plant species growth responses suggest future shifts in species composition with atmospheric change. Consistently increased C fixation, soil respiration and DOC production over 9Â years of CO2 enrichment provide clear evidence for accelerated C cycling with no apparent consequences on the N cycle in this treeline ecosystem.",

Changes in these environmental factors correspond with shifts in plant phenology. In this study, we examined the relationship between canopy phenophases (pre-growth, growth, pre-dormancy, and dormancy) and SR sensitivity to changes in soil temperature (TS). SR was measured 53Â times over 550Â days within an oak forest in northwest Ohio, USA. Annual estimates of SR were calculated with a Q10 model based on TS on a phenological (PT), or annual timescale (AT), or TS and soil volumetric water content (VWC) on a phenological (PTM) or annual (ATM) timescale. We found significant (p<0.01) difference in apparent Q10 from year 2004 (1.23) and year 2005 (2.76) during the growth phenophase. Accounting for moisture-sensitivity increased model performance compared to temperature-only models: the error was -17% for the ATM model and -6% for the PTM model. The annual models consistently underestimated SR in summer and overestimated it in winter. These biases were reduced by delineating SR by tree phenophases and accounting for variation in soil moisture. Even though the bias of annual models in winter SR was small in absolute scale, the relative error was about 91%, and may thus have significant implications for regional and continental C balance estimates.",

The goal of this study was to contribute to filling this data gap by estimating the quantity of carbon in the biomass, soil and necromass for 23 long-term permanent forest plots in five life zones of Venezuela to determine how C was partitioned among these components across a range of environments. Aboveground biomass C ranged from 70 to 179 Mg ha-1 and soil C from 125 to 257 Mg ha-1, and they represented the two largest C components in all plots. The C in fine litter (2.4 to 5.2 Mg ha-1), dead wood (2.4 to 21.2 Mg ha-1) and roots (23.6 to 38.0 Mg ha-1) accounted for less than 13% of the total C. The total amount of C among life zones ranged from 302 to 488 Mg ha-1, and showed no clear trend with life zone. In three of the five life zones, more C was found in the dead (soil, litter, dead wood) than in the live (biomass) components (dead to live ratios of 1.3 to 2.3); the lowland moist and moist transition to dry life zones had dead to live ratios of less than one. Results from this research suggest that for most life zones, an amount equivalent to between 20 and 58% of the aboveground biomass is located in necromass and roots. These percentages coupled with reliable estimates of aboveground biomass from forest inventories enable a more complete estimation of the C content of tropical forests to be made.",

Downed wood was separated into fine (< 10 cm in diameter) and coarse (= 10 cm in diameter) classes, and three decomposition states (sound, intermediate, or rotten). The total quantity of dead wood, averaged by life zone, was lowest in the dry (2.43 Mg/ha), reached a peak in the moist (42.33 Mg/ha) and decreased slightly in the wet (34.50 Mg/ha) life zone. Most of the dead wood was in the standing dead category (about 42-76% of the total). The decomposition state of dead wood in all plots was mostly rotten (45%) or intermediate (44%); there was little sound wood (11%). Turnover rates of dead wood generally ranged between 0.03/yr to 0.52/yr with no clear trend with life zone. The large amount of dead wood in some plots was equivalent to about 20 percent or less of aboveground biomass, indicating that dead wood can represent a significant amount of carbon in these forests.

Prediction of ecosystem responses to multi-factor global changes in a future world strongly relies on our understanding of their interactions. However, it is still unclear how nitrogen (N) deposition and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] would interactively influence forest floor soil respiration in subtropical China. We assessed the main and interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and N addition on soil respiration by growing tree seedlings in ten large open-top chambers under CO2 (ambient CO2 and 700 Âµmol mol-1) and nitrogen (ambient and 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1) treatments. Soil respiration, soil temperature and soil moisture were measured for 30 months, as well as above-ground biomass, root biomass and soil organic matter (SOM). Results showed that soil respiration displayed strong seasonal patterns with higher values observed in the wet season (April-September) and lower values in the dry season (October-March) in all treatments. Significant exponential relationships between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures, as well as significant linear relationships between soil respiration rates and soil moistures (below 15%) were found. Both CO2 and N treatments significantly affected soil respiration, and there was significant interaction between elevated [CO2] and N addition (p<0.001, p=0.003, and p=0.006, respectively). We also observed that the stimulatory effect of individual elevated [CO2] (about 29% increased) was maintained throughout the experimental period. The positive effect of N addition was found only in 2006 (8.17% increased), and then had been weakened over time. Their combined effect on soil respiration (about 50% increased) was greater than the impact of either one alone. Mean value of annual soil respiration was 5.32 Â± 0.08, 4.54 Â± 0.10, 3.56 Â± 0.03 and 3.53 Â± 0.03 kg CO2 m-2 yr-1 in the chambers exposed to elevated [CO2] and high N deposition (CN), elevated [CO2] and ambient N deposition (CC), ambient [CO2] and high N deposition (NN), and ambient [CO2] and ambient N deposition (CK as a control), respectively. Greater above-ground biomass and root biomass was obtained in the CN, CC and NN treatments, and higher soil organic matter was observed only in the CN treatment. In conclusion, the combined effect of elevated [CO2] and N addition on soil respiration was apparent interaction. They should be evaluated in combination in subtropical forest ecosystems in China where the atmospheric CO2 and N deposition have been increasing simultaneously and remarkably. ",

Methodology/Principal Findings Field plots in three typical forests [i.e. pine forest (PF), broadleaf forest (BF), and pine and broadleaf mixed forest (MF)] in subtropical China were exposed under either Double Precipitation (DP) treatment or Ambient Precipitation (AP). Soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil microbial biomass and fine root biomass were measured over three years. We tested whether precipitation treatments influenced the relationship of soil respiration rate (R) with soil temperature (T) and soil moisture (M) using R = (a+cM)exp(bT), where a is a parameter related to basal soil respiration; b and c are parameters related to the soil temperature and moisture sensitivities of soil respiration, respectively. We found that the DP treatment only slightly increased mean annual soil respiration in the PF (15.4%) and did not significantly change soil respiration in the MF and the BF. In the BF, the increase in soil respiration was related to the enhancements of both soil fine root biomass and microbial biomass. The DP treatment did not change model parameters, but increased soil moisture, resulting in a slight increase in soil respiration. In the MF and the BF, the DP treatment decreased soil temperature sensitivity b but increased basal soil respiration a, resulting in no significant change in soil respiration. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that precipitation increasing in subtropical regions in China may have limited effects on soil respiration. ",

Studies of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling provide insights into factors limiting tree growth and forest productivity. To investigate rates of tropical forest litter production and decomposition in relation to nutrient availability and topography in the absence of confounding large-scale variation in climate and altitude we quantified nutrient fluxes via litterfall and leaf litter decomposition within three distinct floristic associations of tropical rain forest growing along a soil fertility gradient at the Sepilok Forest Reserve (SFR), Sabah, Malaysia. The quantity and nutrient content of small litter decreased along a gradient of soil nutrient availability from alluvial forest (most fertile) through sandstone forest to heath forest (least fertile). Temporal variation in litterfall was greatest in the sandstone forest, where the amount of litter was correlated negatively with rainfall in the previous month. Mass loss and N and P release were fastest from alluvial forest litter, and slowest from heath forest litter. All litter types decomposed most rapidly in the alluvial forest. Stand-level N and P use efficiencies (ratios of litter dry mass to nutrient content) were greatest for the heath forest followed by the sandstone ridge, sandstone valley and alluvial forests, respectively. We conclude that nutrient supply limits productivity most in the heath forest and least in the alluvial forest. Nutrient supply limited productivity in sandstone forest, especially on ridge and hill top sites where nutrient limitation may be exacerbated by reduced rates of litter decomposition during dry periods. The fluxes of N and P varied significantly between the different floristic communities at SFR and these differences may contribute to small-scale variation in species composition.",

This generalization has not been typically supported by the few whole-ecosystem, stand-scale eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange in old-growth forests. An eddy-flux tower installed in a >300-year-old hemlock-hardwood forest near the Sylvania Wilderness, Ottawa National Forest, MI, USA, observed a small annual carbon sink of CO2 of -72Â Â±Â 36Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and -147Â Â±Â 42Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003. This carbon sink was much smaller than carbon sinks of -438Â Â±Â 49Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and -490Â Â±Â 48Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003 observed by a nearby flux tower in a 70-year-old mature hardwood forest (Willow Creek, WI). The mature forest had vegetation similar to the old-growth site prior to European settlement. Both sites had slightly larger carbon sinks in 2003, which was a drier and cooler year than 2002. However, the difference in sink strength between the two years was smaller than the uncertainty in the results arising from missing and screened data. Both sites also had significant systematic errors due to non-representative fluxes during certain micrometeorological conditions, which required careful screening. The difference in sink strength between the two sites was driven mainly by greater ER at the old-growth site (965Â Â±Â 35Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and 883Â Â±Â 69Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003) compared to the mature site (668Â Â±Â 21Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and 703Â Â±Â 17Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003). GEP was lower at the old-growth site (1037Â Â±Â 47Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and 1030Â Â±Â 41Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003) compared to the mature site (1106Â Â±Â 47Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2002 and 1192Â Â±Â 51Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in 2003), especially in 2003. Observations also suggested that growing season ER had greater interannual variability at the old-growth site. These results imply that old-growth forests in the region may be carbon sinks, though these sinks are smaller than mature forests, mostly likely due to greater ER.",

The weight of leaf-fall varies from 5 t/ha/year, in plateau forests, to 7,6 t/ha/year in a forest on a wet soil. Weight of ""total litter-fall"" is including between 5,1 and 8,1 t/ha/year. The weight of total ground litter has been measured when experimental plots were set up: it varies from 9,3 to 14,8 t/ha according to the plot and the time of sampling. The plots of the riparian forest differ by the phenology of the leaf-fall from those which are situated in more typical semi-deciduous forests. That is due to the specific rhythm of the leaf-fall of each species on the studied plots. So, we distinguish some species with a heavy leaf-fall during the dry season -- trees of the upper storey and the emergents -- and some others with an evergreen comportment such as underwood trees and some of the upper storey trees of the riparian forest. Among the environmental factors which influence the leaf-fall, present observations suggest that, in some cases, a heavy drying of the soil may start an early leaf-fall",0

We hypothesised that the trenching experiment would alter both microbial biomass and microbial community structure and that fine roots (less than 2Â mm diameter) would be decomposed within one growing season. Soil CO2 efflux was measured roughly biweekly over two growing seasons. Root presence and morphology parameters, as well as the soil microbial community were measured prior to trenching, 5 and 15Â months after trenching. The trenched plots emitted about 20 and 30% less CO2 than the control plots in the first and second growing season, respectively. Roots died in trenched plots, but root decay was slow. After 5 and 15Â months, fine root biomass was decreased by 9% (not statistically different) and 30%, (statistically different) respectively. When we corrected for the additional trenched-plot CO2 efflux due to fine root decomposition, the autotrophic soil respiration rose to ~26% of the total soil respiration for the first growing season, and to ~44% for the second growing season. Soil microbial biomass and community structure was not altered by the end of the second growing season. We conclude that trenching can give accurate estimates of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration, if methodological side effects are accounted for, only.",

We also monitored controlling factors: soil temperature, moisture, organic layer mass, and A layer depth. Soil moisture and CO2 efflux varied with soil texture differences among the stands. As expected, soil temperature had a strong influence on soil CO2 efflux. Soil moisture, organic layer mass, and A layer depth also were correlated with soil CO2 efflux during periods of water stress, but these relationships differed with soil texture. Forest management activities can alter components of soil CO2 efflux, including soil carbon pools, temperature, and moisture; understanding the underlying variation of these components and resultant CO2 efflux over soil types can help guide management toward desired forest carbon balance trends in southeastern mixed pine forests.",

The measurements were obtained by eddy correlation. There is a very sharply pronounced growing season of 100 days when the forest is leaved. Maximum half hourly uptake rates are 18 Âµmol m-2 s-1; maximum respiration rates are 5 Âµmol m-2 s-1. Net annual sequestration of carbon was estimated at 160 gCm-2 in 2001. Applying no correction for low friction velocities added 60 g C m-2. The net carbon exchange of the forest was extremely sensitive to small changes in weather that may switch the forest easily from a sink to a source, even in summer. June was the month with highest uptake in 2001. The average evaporation rate of the forest approached 1.46 mm day-1 during the growing season, with peak values of 3 mm day-1 with an estimated annual evaporation of 213 mm, closely approaching the average annual rainfall amount. 2001 was a drier year than 2000 and this is reflected in lower evaporation rates in 2001 than in 2000. The surface conductance of the forest shows a marked response to increasing atmospheric humidity deficits. This affects the CO2 uptake and evaporation in a different manner, with the CO2 uptake being more affected. There appears to be no change in the relation between surface conductance and net ecosystem uptake normalized by the atmospheric humidity deficit at the monthly time scale. The response to atmospheric humidity deficit is an efficient mechanism to prevent severe water loss during the short intense growing season. The associated cost to the sequestration of carbon may be another explanation for the slow growth of these forests in this environment. ",

However, little is known on their role in the carbon (C) cycling in boreal forests. We measured temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from three different-sized wood ant mounds and the surrounding forest floor from May 2004 to April 2005 in Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] dominated forests in eastern Finland. Additionally, mound and forest floor temperatures were measured continuously and CO2 effluxes at 2-4-week-intervals. During the ants' active season (May-September), measurements were conducted in the morning, afternoon, evening and at night, while fluxes were measured once a day during the ants' inactive season. CO2 emissions from the mounds were up to nearly eight times higher than those from the surrounding forest floor during the active season of the ants, but no statistically significant differences were observed during the period from October to February. Both mound and forest floor CO2 fluxes were highly correlated to mound or forest floor temperature. Based on our measurements, we are able to estimate the annual CO2 efflux from ant mounds and the surrounding forest floor, based on nonlinear regression analyses using CO2 flux as dependant and mound or forest floor temperatures as independent variables. Although red wood ant mounds were found to be â€œhot spotsâ€ for CO2 efflux, that increase the spatial heterogeneity of C emissions within a forest ecosystem, their annual emissions were only 0.30% of that from the forest floor. Thus, our results indicate that red wood ant mounds do not directly contribute significantly to the overall C budget of the boreal forest ecosystem studied.",

We compared the impact of two types of disturbances that represent the most likely future conditions of currently dense ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States: (1) high-intensity fire and (2) thinning, designed to reduce fire intensity. High-severity fire had a larger impact on ecosystem carbon uptake and storage than thinning. Total ecosystem carbon was 42% lower at the intensely burned site, 10 years after burning, than at the undisturbed site. Eddy covariance measurements over two years showed that the burned site was a net annual source of carbon to the atmosphere whereas the undisturbed site was a sink. Net primary production (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency were lower at the burned site than at the undisturbed site. In contrast, thinning decreased total ecosystem carbon by 18%, and changed the site from a carbon sink to a source in the first post-treatment year. Thinning also decreased ET, reduced the limitation of drought on carbon uptake during summer, and did not change water use efficiency. Both disturbances reduced ecosystem carbon uptake by decreasing gross primary production (55% by burning, 30% by thinning) more than total ecosystem respiration (TER; 33-47% by burning, 18% by thinning), and increased the contribution of soil carbon dioxide efflux to TER. The relationship between TER and temperature was not affected by either disturbance. Efforts to accurately estimate regional carbon budgets should consider impacts on carbon dynamics of both large disturbances, such as high-intensity fire, and the partial disturbance of thinning that is often used to prevent intense burning. Our results show that thinned forests of ponderosa pine in the southwestern United States are a desirable alternative to intensively burned forests to maintain carbon stocks and primary production.",

Aims: Here we report on the first study of productivity, allocation and carbon cycling from a terra preta plot in eastern Amazonia (Caxiuano, Para, Brazil), and contrast its dynamics with a nearby plot on infertile soil (ferralsols). Methods: We determined total net primary production (NPP) for fine roots, wood, and canopy and total autotrophic respiration (rhizosphere, wood, and canopy respiration) from two 1-ha plots on contrasting soils. Results: Both gross primary productivity (GPP) (35.68 Â± 3.65 vs. 32.08 Â± 3.46 Mg C ha-1 year-1) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) (0.44 Â± 0.06 vs. 0.42 Â± 0.05) were slightly higher at the terra preta plot. Total NPP (15.77 Â± 1.13 Mg C ha-1 year-1 vs. 13.57 Â± 0.60 Mg C ha-1 year-1) and rates of fine root production (6.41 Â± 1.08 vs. 3.68 Â± 0.52 Mg C ha-1 year-1) were also greater at the terra preta plot vs. the tower plot. Conclusions: Forests on terra preta soil fix slightly more carbon and allocate slightly more of that carbon towards growth than forests on the infertile plot, which leads to greater total NPP, which was disproportionately allocated to fine roots. However, since increased fine root NPP was partially offset by increased heterotrophic soil respiration, the increased root growth was unlikely to greatly enhance soil carbon stocks in terra preta soils.

Here we concentrate on the cumulative effect of random uncertainty on annual estimates of net ecosystem productivity of carbon (NEP). A 8-year data set of eddy covariance measurements over a mixed deciduous forest at the Morgan-Monroe State Forest (MMSF, Indiana, USA) was used, in conjunction with a 6-day period of paired observations with the AmeriFlux portable system, to evaluate two different approaches to estimate measurement system uncertainty, and an analogous method to estimate the uncertainty in a standard parametric model used to fill data gaps in the annual time series. The cumulative annual uncertainty was obtained by Monte Carlo simulation, separately for the observations and the model estimates. Our results indicate that the overall uncertainty of annual NEP is dominated by the contribution of the gap-filling model, even at relatively small gap fractions of 20%. The magnitude of random uncertainty in NEP varied between Â±10-12 gC m-2 yr-1 (i.e., 3-4% of annual NEP at MMSF for years 1999-2006). Thus it must be expected that random uncertainty of eddy-covariance-based NEP is small compared to other potential sources of systematic bias, but we note that very little is known about the long-term cumulative covariate effects of systematic bias in the measured flux.

We attempted to: (1) identify the factors limiting this flux using additions of glucose and an electron transport uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone); and (2) improve yearly estimates of Rr by directly measuring its Q10in situ using temperature-controlled cuvettes buried around intact, attached roots. The proximal limits of Rr of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and N fertilization were seasonally variable; enzyme capacity limited Rr in the winter, and a combination of substrate supply and adenylate availability limited Rr in summer months. The limiting factors of Rr were not affected by elevated CO2 or N fertilization. Elevated CO2 increased annual stand-level Rr by 34% whereas the combination of elevated CO2 and N fertilization reduced Rr by 40%. Measurements of in situ Rr with high temporal resolution detected diel patterns that were correlated with canopy photosynthesis with a lag of 1 d or less as measured by eddy covariance, indicating a dynamic link between canopy photosynthesis and root respiration. These results suggest that Rr is coupled to daily canopy photosynthesis and increases with carbon allocation below ground. ",

However, much less understanding of belowground phenology hinders integrating belowground and aboveground phenology. We measured root respiration (R a) as a surrogate for root phenology and integrated it with observed leaf phenology and radial growth in a birch (Betula platyphylla)-aspen (Populus davidiana) forest and an adjacent larch (Larix gmelinii) forest in Northeast China. A log-normal model successfully described the seasonal variations of R a and indicated the initiation, termination and peak date of root phenology. Both root phenology and leaf phenology were highly specific, with a later onset, earlier termination, and shorter period of growing season for the pioneer tree species (birch and aspen) than the dominant tree species (larch). Root phenology showed later initiation, later peak and later termination dates than leaf phenology. An asynchronous correlation of R a and radial growth was identified with a time lag of approximately 1Â month, indicating aprioritization of shoot growth. Furthermore, we found that R a was strongly correlated with soil temperature and air temperature, while radial growth was only significantly correlated with air temperature, implying a down-regulating effect of temperature. Our results indicate different phenologies between pioneer and dominant species and support a down-regulation hypothesis of plant phenology which can be helpful in understanding forest dynamics in the context of climate change.",

The ecosystem shifted from a source (+41 g C m-2, 1995) to a sink (-21 g C m-2, 2004) of CO2 over the decade, with an average net carbon balance near zero. Annual mean temperatures increased 1-2Â° during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome. We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.

Net CO2 exchange can be estimated on an annual basis, using eddy-covariance techniques or from ecological inventories of C fluxes to and from a forest. Here we present an intercomparison of annual estimates of C exchange in a mixed hardwood forest in the Morgan-Monroe State Forest, Indiana, USA for two years, 1998 and 1999. Based on eddy-covariance measurements made at 1.8 times canopy height from a tower, C uptake by the forest was 237 and 287 g C m-2 y-1 for 1998 and 1999, respectively. For the same time period, biometric and ecophysiological measures and modelled estimates of all significant carbon fluxes within deciduous forests were made, including: change in living biomass, aboveground and belowground detritus production, foliage consumption, and forest floor and soil respiration. Using this ecological inventory method for these same two time periods, C uptake was estimated to be 271 and 377 g C m-2 y-1, which are 14.3% and 31.4% larger, respectively, than the tower-based values. The relative change between this method's annual estimates is consistent with that of the eddy-covariance based values. Our results indicate that the difference in annual C exchange rates was due to reduced heterotrophic soil respiration in 1999. ",

In this study, stem girdling was used to terminate autotrophic soil respiration including rhizosphere respiration and root exudation in a temperate Norway spruce stand. Rates of soil respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) formation were measured in the second year after girdling, comparing an intact plant-rhizosphere continuum with an exclusive decomposer system. The molecular and isotopic composition of DOC in the soil solution was analysed with a coupled Py-GC/MS-C-IRMS system to distinguish between the carbon sources of dissolved carbon. Pyrolysis products were grouped according to their precursor origins: polysaccharides, proteins or of mixed origin (mainly derivates of lignins and proteins). When dead roots became available for decomposition, rates of heterotrophic soil respiration in girdling plots peaked at 6.5Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, comparable to peak rates of total soil respiration (autotrophic and heterotrophic) in control plots, 6.1Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1. A significant response of soil respiration to temperature was found in control plots only, showing that an unlimiting supply of organic substrates for microbial respiration may mask any temperature effects. The enhanced decomposition in girdled plots was further supported by the isotopic composition of DOC in soil solution; all three precursor groups became isotopically enriched as the growing season progressed (polysaccharides by 2.3â€°, proteins by 1.9â€°, mixed origin group by 2.2â€°). This indicates a trophic level shift due to incorporation of organic substrate into the microbial food chain. In the control plots' mixed origin fraction, the isotopic composition changed over time from a signature resembling that of lignin (-28.9â€°) to one similar of the protein fraction (-25.7â€°). Significant temporal changes of structural DOC composition occurred in the girdling plots only. These results suggest that changes in the microbial community and in decomposition rates occurred in both girdled and control plots in the following ways: (i) increased substrate availability (dead roots) gave rise to generally enhanced performance of the decomposer community in girdled plots, (ii) root-derived exudates probably contributed to enhanced decomposition of recalcitrant lignin in the control plots and (iii) the structural composition of DOC seemed to be more a result of decomposition than of plant root exudation in all plots.",

Soil CO2 effluxes showed a distinct seasonal trend in the range of 0.48-3.3Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 for beech and 0.50-2.92Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 for spruce and were well-correlated with near-surface soil temperatures.

Observed soil CO2 concentrations and effluxes were simulated using a Fickian diffusion-reaction model based on vertical CO2 production rates and soil diffusivity. Temporal trends were simulated on the basis of observed trends in the distribution of soil water, temperature, and live roots as well as temperature and water content sensitivity functions. These functions were established based on controlled laboratory incubation experiments. The model was successfully validated against observed soil CO2 effluxes and concentrations and revealed that temporal trends generally could be linked to variations in subsurface CO2 production rates and diffusion over time and with depths. However, periods with exceptionally high CO2 effluxes (> 20Â Âµmol CO2Â m-2Â s-1) were noted in March 2000 in relation to drying after heavy rain and after the removal of snow from collars. Both cases were considered non-steady state and could not be simulated.",

These processes may be influenced by land use and cover change, and abandonment especially in the upper soil organic layer. Seven environments from cultivation to late abandonment, with the same soil type classified as Lithic Xerorthent, were tested to ascertain the respiration capacity according to the current use and cover, and to establish the ability to preserve and eventually increase the organic matter pools after abandonment. Given the importance of carbon dioxide measurements at soil surface, a comparison between the classic soda lime method (SL) and a rapid method based on infrared sensor analyzer (IR) was performed from autumn 2008 to autumn 2009 in the field. The field measurements of CO2 proved significant correlations between the values from the two techniques under the same natural conditions and along the period of observation. However, the values of CO2 measured by the soda lime method were always higher than those obtained by the infrared analyzer. This pattern was attributed to the difference in time of measurement, larger in the former method, and type of measurement technique. Despite that the trend of measured CO2 values was rather similar along the year. On average, the highest values of CO2 emission in the field were recorded in the warmest periods of the year and with soil surface moisture not lower than 3% independently on the method used. High soil surface temperature with soil moisture below 3% decreased drastically the CO2 production from the dry soil. The cultivated environments and soil under forests have resulted higher CO2 producers than abandoned soils depending on the age of abandonment, climatic conditions, and within abandonment perturbations. Those abandoned soils preserved by perturbations like wildfire showed a higher potential for accumulating organic carbon, as indicated by the lowest emission of CO2 with respect to SOC content, during the period of observation. Results demonstrated the reliability of the methods used to evaluate the soil carbon dioxide production capacity and allowed to classify through environments with increasing potential for carbon sequestration. The classification was rather similar by using both methods indicating a higher susceptibility to carbon loss in the following order: soil under Vines (V)Â >Â under Olives (O)Â >Â under Pine trees (PI)Â >Â under Cork Trees (S)Â >Â under Pasture (PR)Â >Â under Cistus scrub (MC)Â >Â under Erica scrub (MB) by using the SL method and VÂ >Â OÂ >Â PIÂ >Â SÂ >Â MCÂ >Â MBÂ >Â PR by using the IR method.

Rhizosphere respiration exhibited pronounced seasonal variation from 0.2 g C m-2 day-1 in January to 2.3 g C m-2 day-1 in July. Rhizosphere respiration accounted for 30 to 60% of total soil CO2 efflux, with an annual mean of 52%.

Soil respiration exhibited pronounced seasonal variations that clearly reflected those of soil water content, with minimum values below 1.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 at the end of the dry season in September and a maximum value of 5.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 after re-wetting in December. An empirical model describing the relationship between soil respiration and soil water content predicts the seasonal variations in soil respiration reasonably well (R2 = 0.88), even if the effects of soil temperature and soil water content may be confounded since both factors co-vary across seasons. Spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration was clearly affected by management practices with higher respiration rate in slash inter-rows which received higher amounts of detritus at the logging stage, and lower respiration rate in haulage inter-rows used for heavy vehicle traffic. Higher values of soil respiration were also recorded in the vicinity of trunks than in the middle of the inter-rows. While soil water content is the main determinant of seasonal variation of soil respiration, it poorly accounts for its spatial variability over the experimental stand, except for days with low soil water content. Soil respiration was related neither to root biomass nor to soil carbon content, but was positively correlated with both leaf and total aboveground litter (i.e. leaf, bark and woody debris). Plots exhibiting the highest soil respiration also contained the highest amounts of aboveground litter. Microbial respiration associated with litter decomposition is likely a major component of soil respiration, and the spatial heterogeneity in litter fall probably accounts for most of its spatial variability in this Eucalyptus plantation.",

Our estimate of heterotrophic respiration was calculated assuming that it was similar to soil respiration in the clear-cut area except that the decomposition of residues did not occur, and it was further corrected for differences in soil water content between intact and clear-cut plots and for the cessation of leaf and fine root turnover in clear cut. Heterotrophic respiration in clear-cut plots was estimated at 1.18 kgC m-2 yr-1 whereas it was only 0.65 kgC m-2 yr-1 in intact plots (41% of soil respiration).

Nevertheless, it is just as valuable to quantify fluxes from recently disturbed forests so that we can recognize and predict the impact of disturbance on carbon fluxes. We measured carbon fluxes and microclimatic variables within a naturally regenerating, young (12-14 years of age) jack pine ecosystem in northern Michigan. During the months June to October of 2001-2003, this ecosystem exhibited a low net uptake of approximately 17.8-18.3 g C m-2 5 months-1. Soil respiration was independently measured and then modeled on the basis of soil temperature and soil moisture. Model estimates of soil respiration were 627, 583, and 681 g C m-2 5 months-1 from June to October in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil respiration were inversely correlated in midsummer (r = -0.6, p = 0.001) during the period of lowest NEE (greatest uptake) and highest soil respiration rates. In the spring, NEE and soil respiration were positively correlated (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). During the fall, when soil temperatures remained fairly steady and air temperatures fluctuated, this coefficient between NEE and soil respiration declined to an average -0.25 (p = 0.2). Our results indicate that 12-14 years following disturbance this ecosystem displays a small net uptake during the June to October months but respiratory losses during the snow season (mid-October to April) could possibly counterbalance this carbon gain.

Forests were sampled using six 0.1 ha plots in mature primary forest and sites 0.4, 4, 8 and 12 years since logging. Clear-cutting reduced overstory (trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh) basal area, biomass and richness to 7%, 4%, and 17%, respectively, of primary forest levels. By the twelfth year 46% of basal area, 37% of biomass, and 38% of richness had returned. However, 63% of biomass and 50% of richness were composed of â€˜core pioneer' species. The replacement of primary (climax) species dominants by pioneer species indicates that the early process of regeneration is more appropriately described as secondary succession. Age since clear-cutting during the first 12 years of growth was a significant linear predictor of both pioneer and climax species biomass and basal area, but not climax richness. Extrapolation of these trends beyond 12 years suggest that overstory basal area and biomass would equal that of mature rain forests by 30 years (the proposed rotation time). However, the decline in pioneer growth rates over time, the slow climax growth rates, and the failure to predict observations in an 18-year old stand indicate that such a model is unrealistic. Climax species need longer than 30 years to recover, and biomass may decline between 15 and 30 years if many short-lived pioneer trees die before climax trees are well established. More consideration needs to be given to understanding the regeneration of climax species if conservation and harvesting are to be combined. Putting part of the concession under a longer rotation time may permit climax trees to regenerate successfully.",

Annual FCO2 for the undisturbed northern hardwood forest was estimated at 660 Â± 54 g CÂ·m<U+0096>2Â·year<U+0096>1. Low soil moisture significantly reduced FCO2 on three of the measurement dates. The proportion of FCO2 derived from the forest floor horizons was estimated empirically to be about 58%. We estimated that respiration of root tissues contributed about 40% of FCO2, with a higher proportion for mineral soil (46%) than for forest floor (35%). Soil C-balance calculations, based upon evidence that major soil C pools are near steady state at this site, indicated a large C flux associated with root exudation plus allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (80 g CÂ·m<U+0096>2Â·year<U+0096>1, or 17% of total root C allocation); however, uncertainty in this estimate is high owing especially to high error bounds for root respiration flux.

The largest pools of C in the reference watershed (W6) reside in mineral soil organic matter (43% of total ecosystem C) and living biomass (40.5%), with the remainder in surface detritus (14.5%). Repeated sampling indicated that none of these pools was changing significantly in the late-1990s, although high spatial variability precluded the detection of small changes in the soil organic matter pools, which are large; hence, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in this 2nd growth forest was near zero (Â± about 20Â gÂ C/m2-yr) and probably similar in magnitude to fluvial export of organic C. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of the forest declined by 24% between the late-1950s (462Â gÂ C/m2-yr) and the late-1990s (354Â gÂ C/m2-yr), illustrating age-related decline in forest NPP, effects of multiple stresses and unusual tree mortality, or both. Application of the simulation model PnET-II predicted 14% higher ANPP than was observed for 1996-1997, probably reflecting some unknown stresses. Fine litterfall flux (171Â gÂ C/m2-yr) has not changed much since the late-1960s. Because of high annual variation, C flux in woody litterfall (including tree mortality) was not tightly constrained but averaged about 90Â gÂ C/m2-yr. Carbon flux to soil organic matter in root turnover (128Â gÂ C/m2-yr) was only about half as large as aboveground detritus. Balancing the soil C budget requires that large amounts of C (80Â gÂ C/m2-yr) were transported from roots to rhizosphere carbon flux. Total soil respiration (TSR) ranged from 540 to 800Â gÂ C/m2-yr across eight stands and decreased with increasing elevation within the northern hardwood forest near W6. The watershed-wide TSR was estimated as 660Â gÂ C/m2-yr. Empirical measurements indicated that 58% of TSR occurred in the surface organic horizons and that root respiration comprised about 40% of TSR, most of the rest being microbial. Carbon flux directly associated with other heterotrophs in the HBEF was minor; for example, we estimated respiration of soil microarthropods, rodents, birds and moose at about 3, 5, 1 and 0.8Â gÂ C/m2-yr, respectively, or in total less than 2% of NPP. Hence, the effects of other heterotrophs on C flux were primarily indirect, with the exception of occasional irruptions of folivorous insects. Hydrologic fluxes of C were significant in the watershed C budget, especially in comparison with NEP. Although atmospheric inputs (1.7Â gÂ C/m2-yr) and streamflow outputs (2.7Â gÂ C/m2-yr) were small, larger quantities of C were transported within the ecosystem and a more substantial fraction of dissolved C was transported from the soil as inorganic C and evaded from the stream as CO2 (4.0Â gÂ C/m2-yr). Carbon pools and fluxes change rapidly in response to catastrophic disturbances such as forest harvest or major windthrow events. These changes are dominated by living vegetation and dead wood pools, including roots. If biomass removal does not accompany large-scale disturbance, the ecosystem is a large net source of C to the atmosphere (500-1200Â gÂ C/m2-yr) for about a decade following disturbance and becomes a net sink about 15-20Â years after disturbance; it remains a net sink of about 200-300Â gÂ C/m2-yr for about 40Â years before rapidly approaching steady state. Shifts in NPP and NEP associated with common small-scale or diffuse forest disturbances (e.g., forest declines, pathogen irruptions, ice storms) are brief and much less dramatic. Spatial and temporal patterns in C pools and fluxes in the mature forest at the HBEF reflect variation in environmental factors. Temperature and growing-season length undoubtedly constrain C fluxes at the HBEF; however, temperature effects on leaf respiration may largely offset the effects of growing season length on photosynthesis. Occasional severe droughts also affect C flux by reducing both photosynthesis and soil respiration. In younger stands nutrient availability strongly limits NPP, but the role of soil nutrient availability in limiting C flux in the mature forest is not known. A portion of the elevational variation of ANPP within the HBEF probably is associated with soil resource limitation; moreover, sites on more fertile soils exhibit 20-25% higher biomass and ANPP than the forest-wide average. Several prominent biotic influences on C pools and fluxes also are clear. Biomass and NPP of both the young and mature forest depend upon tree species composition as well as environment. Similarly, litter decay differs among tree species and forest types, and forest floor C accumulation is twice as great in the spruce-fir-birch forests at higher elevations than in the northern hardwood forests, partly because of inherently slow litter decay and partly because of cold temperatures. This contributes to spatial patterns in soil solution and streamwater dissolved organic carbon across the Hubbard Brook Valley. Wood decay varies markedly both among species and within species because of biochemical differences and probably differences in the decay fungi colonizing wood. Although C biogeochemistry at the HBEF is representative of mountainous terrain in the region, other sites will depart from the patterns described at the HBEF, due to differences in site history, especially agricultural use and fires during earlier logging periods. Our understanding of the C cycle in northern hardwood forests is most limited in the area of soil pool size changes, woody litter deposition and rhizosphere C flux processes.",

The consequences of this transition are unclear due to uncertainty around the C dynamics of old-growth forests. Canopy structural complexity (CSC) has been shown to be an important source of variability in C dynamics in younger forests (e.g., in productivity and resilience to disturbance), but its role in late-successional forests has not been widely addressed. We investigated patterns of CSC in two old-growth forest landscapes in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, to assess factors associated with CSC and its influence on productivity and disturbance resilience (to moderate-severity windstorm). CSC was quantified using a portable below-canopy LiDAR (PCL) system in 65 plots that also had long-term (50-70+ years) inventory data, which were used to quantify aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), disturbance history, and stand characteristics. We found high and variable CSC relative to younger forests across a suite of PCL-derived metrics. Variation in CSC was driven by species composition and size structure, rather than disturbance history or site characteristics. Recent moderate severity wind disturbance decreased plot-scale CSC, but increased stand-scale variation in CSC. The strong positive correlation between CSC and productivity illustrated in younger forests was not present in undisturbed portions of these late-successional ecosystems. Moderate severity disturbance appeared to reestablish the positive link between CSC and productivity, but this relationship was scale and severity dependent. A positive CSC-productivity relationship was evident at the plot scale with low-severity, dispersed disturbance, but only at a patch scale in more severely disturbed areas. CSC does not appear to strongly correlate with variation in productivity in undisturbed old-growth forests, but may play a very important (and scale/severity-dependent) role in their response to disturbance. Understanding potential drivers and consequences of CSC in late-successional forests will inform management focused on promoting complexity and old-growth conditions, and illustrate potential impacts of such treatments on regional C dynamics.",

Based on generalized seasonal patterns classifications of ecosystems into vegetation functional types can be evaluated for use in global productivity and climate change models. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of respiratory costs of assimilated carbon in various ecosystems.Seasonal variability of FGPP and FRE of the investigated sites increased in the order tropical<Mediterranean<temperateconiferous<temperatedeciduous<borealforests. Together with the boreal forest sites, the managed grasslands and crops show the largest seasonal variability. In the temperate coniferous forests, seasonal patterns of FGPP and FRE are in phase, in the temperate deciduous and boreal coniferous forests FRE was delayed compared to FGPP, resulting in the greatest imbalance between respiratory and assimilatory fluxes early in the growing season.FGPP adjusted for the length of the carbon uptake period decreased at the sampling sites across functional types in the order C4 crops, temperate and boreal deciduous forests (7.5-8.3gCm-2perday)>temperate conifers, C3 grassland and crops (5.7-6.9gCm-2perday)>boreal conifers (4.6Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â perÂ day). Annual FGPP and net ecosystem productivity (FNEP) decreased across climate zones in the order tropical>temperate>boreal. However, the decrease in FNEP with latitude was greater than the decrease in FGPP, indicating a larger contribution of respiratory (especially heterotrophic) processes in boreal systems.",

Maximum observed fluxes were +6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 on a monthly average in summer decreasing to +1 to +2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in winter and early spring. Nighttime soil and understory exchange was well described by an exponential function of soil temperature at a depth of 50Â mm during periods of moderate soil moisture, but moisture effects required a modification of the equation at low (0.25Â m3Â m-3) and very high (0.35Â m3Â m-3) soil moisture.

Franco)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) forest. Significant amounts of carbon were recycled within the canopy because carbon flux measured at the below-canopy level was always upward. Maximum fluxes reached 4-6 Âµmol m-2 s-1 of CO2 into the canopy air space during the summer months, often equaling the net downward fluxes measured at the above-canopy level. Ecosystem respiration rates deviated from the expected exponential relationship with temperature during the summer months. An empirical ecosystem stress term was derived from soil water content and understory flux data and was added to the Reco model to account for attenuated respiration during the summer drought. This attenuation term was not needed in 1999, a wet La Nina year. Years in which climate approximated the historical mean, were within the normal range in both NEE and Reco, but enhanced or suppressed Reco had a significant influence on the carbon balance of the entire stand. In years with low respiration the forest acts as a strong carbon sink (-217 g C m-2 year-1), whereas years in which respiration is high can turn the ecosystem into a weak to moderate carbon source (+100 g C m-2 year-1).",

The objective of our research was to determine the response in soil respiration to above- and belowground organic matter manipulation in a Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation. Five organic matter treatments were applied during a 2-year experiment: both litter removal and root trenching (LRRT), only litter removal (LR), control (CK), only root trenching (RT) and litter addition (LA). We found that either aboveground litter removal or root trenching decreased soil respiration. On average, soil respiration rate was significantly decreased in the LRRT treatment, by about 38.93% Â± 2.01% compared to the control. Soil respiration rate in the LR treatment was 30.65% Â± 1.87% and in the RT treatment 17.65% Â± 1.95% lower than in the control. Litter addition significantly increased soil respiration rate by about 25.82% Â± 2.44% compared to the control. Soil temperature and soil moisture were the main factors affecting seasonal variation in soil respiration. Up to the 59.7% to 82.9% seasonal variation in soil respiration is explained by integrating soil temperature and soil moisture within each of the various organic matter treatments. The temperature sensitivity parameter, Q10, was higher in the RT (2.72) and LA (3.19) treatments relative to the control (2.51), but lower in the LRRT (1.52) and LR treatments (1.36). Our data suggest that manipulation of soil organic matter input can not only alter soil CO2 efflux, but also have profound effect on the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon decomposition in a temperate pine forest.

In this study, we investigated spatial variability of the net fluxes of these gases along a 100Â m long slope of a evergreen broadleaved forest in southern China over a whole year. We expected that the lower part of slope would release more N2O and CO2, but take up less atmospheric CH4 than the upper part due to different availability of water and nutrients. Our results showed that the soil moisture (Water Filled Pore Space, WFPS) decreased along the slope from bottom to top as we expected, but among the three gases only N2O emissions followed this pattern. Annual means of WFPS ranged from 27.7% to 52.7% within the slope, and annual emissions of N2O ranged from 2.0 to 4.4Â kg N ha-1 year-1, respectively. These two variables were highly and positively correlated across the slope. Neither potential rates of net N mineralization and nitrification, nor N2O emissions in the laboratory incubated soils varied with slope positions. Soil CO2 release and CH4 uptake appeared to be independent on slope position in this study. Our results suggested that soil water content and associated N2O emissions are likely to be influenced by topography even in a short slope, which may need to be taken into account in field measurements and modelling.",

Soil temperature and moisture at the 10 cm depth were simultaneously measured with the greenhouse gas measurements. Inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) in the 0-10 cm was determined monthly.

Soil CO2 flux in the old-growth forests was mainly driven by soil temperature, followed by soil moisture and NO3--N. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil CO2 flux was lower at lower latitudes with high temperature and more precipitation, probably because of less soil organic carbon (SOC). Soil NO3- accumulation caused by environmental change was often accompanied by an increase in soil CO2 emission. In addition, soil CH4 uptake decreased with an increase in soil moisture. The response of soil CH4 flux to temperature was dependent upon the optimal value of soil temperature in each forest. Soil NH4+-N consumption tended to promote soil CH4 uptake in the old-growth forests, whereas soil NO3--N accumulation was not conducive to CH4 oxidation in anaerobic condition. These results indicate that soil mineral N dynamics largely affects the soil gas fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the old-growth forests, along with climate conditions. ",

At 22 years, the plots were reduced from 5900 to 4100 and 3000 trees per hectare in three replicates.

Above-ground shrub carbon pools were the opposite, i.e., largest in the heaviest thinned plots and lowest in the controls. Soil and litter carbon stocks were not affected by thinning treatment. Results suggest that thinning may positively affect vegetation carbon sequestration in the short term, an important observation for forest managers using thinning to optimize carbon sequestration capacity.",

Merr.), and (3) litter addition with five levels (0, 218, 436, 654 and 873Â gÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, respectively).ResultsIn all forests, an increase in litter input increased litter decomposition, litter carbon (C) loss and soil respiration but did not alter SOC content after 2.5Â years. The increases in litter decomposition, litter C loss, and soil respiration in response to increased litter input were greater with the lower quality Schima superba litter than with the higher quality Ormosia pinnata litter. Litter quality did not affect SOC content at any of the three forest sites. The responses of litter decomposition and soil respiration to increasing litter input differed depending on forest successional stage.ConclusionsIn subtropical forests, increases in litter production under climate change may accelerate C cycling. Net soil C storage in subtropical forests, however, may not change over short time scales in response to increased litter input.",

However, a general assumption exists that productivity, and thus, carbon sequestration of high altitude forests is low, but the scarcity of data from high altitude tropical forests does not allow for a sound confirmation of this assumption. To determine the carbon sequestration potential of natural forest regeneration and reforestation efforts at high altitudes, aboveground biomass was quantified of several successional stages of two monospecific secondary forests in the high Ecuadorian Andes. The studied forests were, at 3200Â m, an Alnus acuminata forest with 8-, 20-, 30- and 45-year-old stands and, at 3600Â m, a Polylepis incana forest with 6-, 15- and 30-year-old stands and old growth forest without known age. Both trees are pioneer species. Additionally, a soil survey was conducted and leaf N/P ratios and N and P retranslocation rates were determined. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) estimates of the oldest stages of the two forests were 241Â MgÂ ha-1 for the Alnus and 366Â MgÂ ha-1 for the Polylepis forest. Productivity, expressed as annual aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) was in both forests highest in the establishment phase (14.2 and 15.0Â MgÂ ha-1 per year at 8 and 6 years, respectively) due to high sapling numbers, and then slowed down significantly (5.9 and 6.9Â MgÂ ha-1 per year, respectively at age 30). TAGB and ABA figures of the investigated forests are comparable to those of lowland tropical forests and do not indicate a significant decrease of these parameters at higher altitudes in the tropics. Analysis of site conditions, ecological requirements and ecophysiological properties of the tree species indicated that in both cases an optimal combination of these factors strongly favoured forest growth. It is not possible to verify whether our forests are representative for other high altitude tropical forests or if they should be treated as exceptional cases. The results do show, however, that high carbon offsets at high altitudes are possible.",

While the majority of tropical secondary forest (SF) studies have examined post-deforestation or post-agricultural succession, we examined post-pasture forest recovery in 10 forests ranging in age from 0 to 14 years since abandonment. We measured aboveground biomass and soil nutrients to 45 cm depth and computed total site carbon (C) and nutrient stocks to gain an understanding of the dynamics of nutrient and C buildup in regenerating SF in central Amazonia. Aboveground biomass accrual was rapid, 11.0 MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, in the young SFs. Within 12-14 yr, they accumulated up to 128.1 Mg/ha of dry aboveground biomass, equivalent to 25-50% of primary forest biomass in the region. Wood nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations decreased with forest age. Aboveground P and calcium (Ca) stocks accumulated at a rate of 1.2 and 29.4 kgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1; extractable soil P stocks declined as forest age increased. Although soil stocks of exchangeable Ca (207.0 Â± 23.7 kg/ha) and extractable P (8.3 Â± 1.5 kg/ha) were low in the first 45 cm, both were rapidly translocated from soil to plant pools. Soil N stocks increased with forest age, probably due to N fixation, atmospheric deposition, and/or subsoil mining. Total soil C storage to 45 cm depth ranged between 42 and 84 Mg/ha, with the first 15 cm storing 40-45% of the total. Total C accrual (7.04 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1) in both aboveground and soil pools was similar or higher than values reported in other studies. Tropical SFs regrowing on lightly to moderately used pasture rapidly sequester C and rebuild total nutrient capital following pasture abandonment. Translocation of some nutrients from deep soil (>45 cm depth) may be important to sustaining productivity and continuing biomass accumulation in these forests. The soil pool represents the greatest potential for long-term C gains; however, soil nutrient deficits may limit future productivity. ",

We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (PV), dry season length (SD), and mean annual air temperature (TA) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within amedian -2.7 to 0.9% of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account.

It is important to understand the environmental controls on soil CO2 efflux, in order to evaluate potential responses of ecosystems to climate change. This study investigated the relationship between total soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, soil moisture and solar radiation on an interannual basis for a plot of temperate deciduous ancient semi-natural woodland at Wytham Woods in central southern England. We also aimed to quantify the contribution of soil organic matter decomposition (SOM), root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration components to total soil CO2 efflux, and determine their environmental correlates. Total soil CO2 efflux was measured regularly from April 2006 to December 2008 and found to average 4.1 MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â yr-1 in both 2007 and 2008. In addition, we applied a recently developed approach to partition the efflux into SOM, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal components in situ using mesh bags. SOM decomposition, root-and-rhizosphere, and mycorrhizal respiration were estimated to contribute 70Â Â±Â 6%, 22Â Â±Â 6% and 8Â Â±Â 3% of total soil CO2 efflux respectively, equating to 3.0Â Â±Â 0.3, 0.9Â Â±Â 0.2 and 0.3Â Â±Â 0.1 MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â yr-1. In order to avoid the effect of temporal correlation between variables caused by seasonality, we investigated interannual variability by examining the relationship between CO2 flux anomalies and anomalies in environmental variables. Variation in soil temperature explained 50% of the interannual variance in soil CO2 efflux, and soil moisture a further 18% of the residual variance. Solar radiation, as a proxy for plant photosynthesis, had no significant effect on total soil CO2 efflux, but was positively correlated with root-and-rhizosphere respiration, and mycorrhizal respiration. The relationship between anomalies in soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature was highly significant, with a sensitivity of 0.164Â Â±Â 0.023Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1Â Â°C-1. For mean peak summer efflux rates (2.03Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m2Â s-1), this is equivalent to 8% per Â°C, or a Q10 temperature sensitivity of 2.2Â Â±Â 0.2. We demonstrate the utility of an anomaly analysis approach and conclude that soil temperature is the key driver of total soil CO2 efflux primarily through its positive relationship with SOM-decomposition rate.",

Biometric methods estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) as 22.0Â Â±Â 1.6Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1, close to the eddy covariance GPP value of 21.1Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1. Annual ecosystem respiration (R ECO) was similar, at 20.3Â Â±Â 1.5Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1 for biometric and 19.8Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1for eddy covariance. The seasonal cycle of monthly biometric and eddy covariance R ECO estimates also closely matched. Net primary productivity (NPP) was 7.0Â Â±Â 0.8Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1, 37% of which was allocated below ground. Leaf fluxes were the greatest component of NPP and R ECO. Ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEÂ =Â NPP/GPP) was 0.32Â Â±Â 0.04; low compared to many temperate broadleaved sites but close to values for old-growth sites. This may reflect the age of some trees, and/or the oceanic climate with relatively mild winters during which there can be substantial autotrophic maintenance respiration in winter but negligible growth. This study demonstrates that biometric measurements can provide robust estimates of site productivity and respiration and that eddy covariance and bottom-up measurements can be combined on seasonal and interannual timescales to enable a detailed understanding of the forest carbon cycle.",

Appropriate silvicultural regimes can therefore be applied as useful tools in climate change mitigation strategies. The present study analyzed the temporal changes in the effects of thinning on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and on soil CO2 emissions in radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) forests. Soil C effluxes were monitored over a period of 2 years in thinned and unthinned plots. In addition, soil samples from the plots were analyzed by solid-state 13C-NMR to determine the post-thinning SOM composition and fresh soil samples were incubated under laboratory conditions to determine their biodegradability. The results indicate that the potential soil C mineralization largely depends on the proportion of alkyl-C and N-alkyl-C functional groups in the SOM and on the microbial accessibility of the recalcitrant organic pool. Soil CO2 effluxes varied widely between seasons and increased exponentially with soil heating. Thinning led to decreased soil respiration and attenuation of the seasonal fluctuations. These effects were observed for up to 20 months after thinning, although they disappeared thereafter. Thus, moderate thinning caused enduring changes to the SOM composition and appeared to have temporary effects on the C storage capacity of forest soils, which is a critical aspect under the current climatic change scenario.",

In southern New England, eastern hemlock is being replaced by the deciduous tree species, black birch (Betula lenta). To date there is little understanding of whether hemlock loss will fundamentally alter ecosystem C balance and component fluxes. In this study, we use a comparative approach to study potential changes in C fluxes and N cycling associated with HWA-induced hemlock decline and replacement. The stands include primary- and secondary-growth hemlock forests (>230 and 132 years old, respectively), recently disturbed stands (5 and 18 years old) that now have rapidly growing black birch saplings, and a mature black birch stand of age similar to the second-growth hemlock stand. We found that aboveground net primary production was higher in the aggrading black birch stand and significantly so at 18-years post-HWA compared to the secondary-hemlock stand it would likely replace. Rapid forest regrowth was accompanied by significantly higher rates of N uptake from the soil but also higher N-use efficiency because most of the N taken up from the soil was allocated to the production of wood with a high C-to-N ratio. In contrast to patterns of aboveground production, the rate of soil respiration was lowest in the young stands and not significantly different from the second-growth hemlock stand, suggesting little net effect of stand replacement on soil C efflux. The leaf litter decomposition study showed that black birch litter decomposed more rapidly than hemlock litter but that there was no effect of stand type on the rate of decomposition. Analyses of extracellular microbial exoenzyme activity painted a more nuanced pattern of variation among stands, with fine root biomass the only weakly explanatory variable. In combination with our prior work on C stocks, these results suggest that forests affected by HWA in southern New England will remain a sink for atmospheric CO2 despite reorganization of stand structure and species composition.

The plantations were dominated by planted black spruce (Picea mariana). The stands of natural forest ranged in age from 55 to 105 years, while the plantations represented a chronosequence of 3 to 21 years. Carbon storage in the aboveground living tree biomass of mature natural stands averaged 74.9 t C/ha-1 (range 57.1 to 92.7 t C/ha-1), compared with a projected 82.5 t C ha-1 in a 60-year-old spruce plantation. Forest-floor biomass was similar among stands of natural forest and plantations (overall average 20.4 t C/ha-1). Woody detrital biomass (snags and coarse woody debris) in mature natural stands averaged 19.1 t C/ha-1, considerably more than in the older plantations studied (0.20 t C/ha-1 in a 21-year-old plantation). Because of clear-cut harvesting and precommercial and commercial thinning, the plantations receive few inputs of snags or coarse woody detritus. The longer-term paucity of these biomass components in plantations has important implications for carbon storage. Overall, our study suggests that a landscape managed as a shifting mosaic of plantations on a 60-year rotation would store only about 22% as much aboveground carbon (i.e., in live trees, snags, coarse woody debris, and the forest floor) as a landscape covered in older-growth natural forest in which gap-phase disturbance dynamics were the primary mechanism of disturbance.",

The aim of this study was then to estimate biomass and carbon accumulation in young secondary forests, from 4 and up to 20Â years of age, as well as its distribution among the different pools (tree including roots, herbaceous understory, dead wood, litter and soil), in humid tropical forests of Costa Rica. Carbon fraction for the different pools and tree components (stem, branches, leaves and roots) was estimated and varies between 37.3% (Â±3.3) and 50.3% (Â±2.9). Average carbon content in the soil was 4.1% (Â±2.1). Average forest plant biomass was 82.2 (Â±47.9) MgÂ ha-1 and the mean annual increment for carbon in the biomass was 4.2Â MgÂ ha-1Â yr-1. Approximately 65.2% of total biomass was found in the aboveground tree components, while 14.2% was found in structural roots and the rest in the herbaceous vegetation and necromass. Carbon in the soil increased by 1.1Â MgÂ ha-1Â yr-1. Total stored carbon in the forest was 180.4Â MgÂ ha-1 at the age of 20Â years. In these forests, most of the carbon (51-83%) was stored in the soil. Models selected to estimate biomass and carbon in trees as predicted by basal area had R2 adjustments above 95%. Results from this study were then compared with those obtained for a variety of secondary and primary forests in different Latin-American tropical ecosystems and in tree plantations in the same study area.",

Here, we irrigated a longleaf pine wiregrass savanna for six years; this increased soil moisture by 41.2%. We tested how an altered precipitation regime affected total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), root growth, soil carbon, and Esoil. We used two methods to quantify Esoil: daytime biweekly manual measurements and automated continuous measurements for one year. We hypothesized that the low-frequency manual method would miss both short- and long-term (i.e., subdaily to annual, respectively) effects of soil moisture on Esoil while the high-frequency data from the automated method would allow the effects of soil moisture to be discerned. Root growth was significantly higher in irrigated plots, particularly at 0-20Â cm depth. Irrigated annual Esoil was significantly greater than that of the control when estimated with the continuous measurements but not when estimated from biweekly measurements. The difference in annual Esoil estimates is likely due to (1) the delayed increase in Esoil following irrigation pulses of soil moisture (i.e., variation that the biweekly manual measurements missed) and (2) the diel timing of biweekly manual measurements (they were completed early to mid-day before peak efflux). With irrigation, estimates of TBCA increased almost two-fold with automated measurements but only 36% with intermittent measurements. Relative to controls, irrigated treatments stored almost 2Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1 more in soils and 0.26Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1 more in roots. High-frequency measurements of Esoil were essential to estimate total belowground carbon allocation. With irrigation, soil carbon pools were not at steady-state, so shifts in soil carbon storage must be considered in TBCA estimates.",

This was attributed to increased nutrient availability and accelerated rates of N and P cycling in mixtures. This study examined whether the increase in aboveground biomass production was associated with an increase in total productivity (both above- and belowground), a change in C partitioning (from below to aboveground) or both. Total annual belowground C allocation (TBCA) was determined during year 11 in a mixed-species trial near Cann River, southeastern Australia. Monocultures of E. globulus (100%E) and A. mearnsii (100%A) and mixtures of these species (50%E:50%A) were planted in a replacement series. Using a conservation of mass approach, TBCA was estimated as soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux C minus the C input from aboveground litter plus changes in the C stored in soil, roots and the forest floor litter layer. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was also estimated to enable comparison of ratios of above and belowground fluxes between treatments. TBCA ranged from 14.6 to 16.3Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1 and was not significantly different in 100%E, 50%E:50%A and 100%A. Higher ratios of ANPP:TBCA in the mixtures (0.41) than in either monoculture (100%A:0.28 100%E:0.31) indicated that trees in mixture partitioned a lower proportion of assimilated C belowground than those in monocultures. Since the mixture was as productive as monocultures belowground but more productive aboveground, it appears to be more productive overall and thus have the potential to increase C sequestration above that of monocultures.",

These features directly influence the carbon balance of the ecosystem, yet few studies have quantified their interactive effects. We experimentally manipulated the forest structure of a second-growth northern hardwood forest in north-central Wisconsin (USA) and measured the shift of C between pools of the ecosystem components. Here, we question the longevity of the changes to the aboveground pools and address their implications for total ecosystem C (TEC) and net ecosystem production (NEP) at both the gap and stand scale. At the scale of the gap, the harvest and removal of trees significantly reduced NEP (-3.2 to -3.5Â Mg C ha-1 for gaps vs 2.2 to 2.5Â Mg C ha-1 for reference conditions), but did not alter heterotrophic respiration. The addition of woody debris without harvest significantly increased heterotrophic respiration, decreasing soil C storage of the gap area (-0.5 to -1.1Â Mg C ha-1). The combined treatment of gap creation and woody debris addition made the gap area a significant C source to the atmosphere for the 3 years of the study (-4.9 to -5.1Â Mg C ha-1). We also estimated how these structural features would affect C dynamics at a broader scale. The conversion of 10% of the stand canopy to gap conditions caused only a brief decrease in the stand NEP with the C balance returning to reference conditions by the third year following tree harvest. The woody debris additions caused an increase in both TEC and heterotrophic respiration. When combined the addition of canopy gaps and woody debris caused plots to initially become significant C sources, relative to undisturbed locations that were consistently accumulating C, with an annual NEP ranging from 2.1 to 2.8Â Mg C ha-1 y-1. Understanding the effects of these structural features on forest C dynamics is highly relevant as the maturing forests of the region transition to more structurally complex forests and the demand for managing ecosystems for long-term C sequestration increases.",

Located at 750 m elevation in Puerto Rico (latitude 18Â°N) the forest had 27 tree species, 3059 stems/ha, a basal area of 42.4 m2/ha, maximum height of 17 m, and a leaf area index of 3.3. Palm (Prestoea montana) dominated the forest, and, with two other species, accounted for 68% of the dominance. Throughfall, stemflow, interception, runoff, transpiration, and evapotranspiration accounted for 81.6, 9.8, 8.6, 77.7, 13.7, and 22.3% of annual rainfall (3725 mm) respectively. The stand carbon storage was 28.77 kg/m2, distributed as follows: aboveground 35.4%, vegetation 44.2%, soil to 1 m depth 55%, palms 10.9%. Vegetation biomass was partitioned as follows: leaves 9.8% (75% are palm leaves), wood 68%, and roots 21.8%. Net aboveground primary carbon productivity (NPP) was 876 gÂ°m-2Â°yr-1. Average litterfall was 2.4 gÂ°m-2Â°d-1 (palm leaves 32%, other leaves 39%, and wood 10%). Half-lives of decaying material were 188, 306, 462, and 576 d, respectively, for palm leaves still attached to the parent tree, dicotyledonous leaves, palm leaves on the ground, and palm trunks. Total organic carbon concentrations in stream water increased with increasing stream discharge (from 2 g/m3 to 30 g/m3). Watershed export of carbon was 50 gÂ°m-2Â°yr-1 (including 12 gÂ°m-2Â°yr-1 in the form of leaf litter). Mean P concentration in palm leaves (1.18 mg/g) was twice that in dicotyledonous leaves (0.64 mg/g). Compared to a rainfall phosphorus input to the watershed of 63 mgÂ°m-2Â°yr-1, leaching from the canopy was high (167 mgÂ°m-2Â°yr-1), as was the loss of P from the watershed (611 mgÂ°m-2Â°yr-1). Phosphorus-conserving mechanisms included a high rate of retranslocation in palms (504 mgÂ°m-2Â°yr-1). In spite of these mechanisms, there was a net P loss from the watershed that ranged from 136 to 544 mgÂ°m-2Â°yr-1. Periodic flooding, poor soil aeration, intensive year-round rainfall, and low atmospheric saturation vapor pressure deficits are believed to be the main driving forces of the floodplain forest, which exhibits many characteristics typical of lowland rain forests and floodplain wetlands. Rates of NPP, litterfall, and biomass turnover (residence time of 14-17 yr) are faster than expected for the climatic conditions, whereas rates of wood production and storage of organic matter in the vegetation and soil profile are lower than expected for the climate.

This period for boreal forests has been assumed to be 10 years, but this has not been validated empirically for most forest types including sub-boreal spruce-dominated forests of central British Columbia, Canada. Therefore, we sought to determine the timing of the source to sink transition for a sub-boreal clearcut. Clearcuts such as the one documented in this study occurring on glaciolacustrine deposits with relatively poor drainage represent about 20% of the 1.5Â millionÂ ha in the Prince George area. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for a clearcut was measured over four growing seasons in years 5, 6, 8 and 10 after harvest. A Bowen ratio approach in combination with a bottom-up modeled NEE based on ecosystem component CO2-flux measurements was used for years 5 and 6. In years 8 and 10, growing season NEE was measured using an open-path eddy covariance system. A cross comparison of Bowen ratio and eddy covariance systems was performed and measurements agreed relatively well (r2Â =Â 0.58). The results demonstrated that while this clearcut was still a source for C (NEE of +336 to +487Â gÂ CÂ m-2) after 6 years, it was most likely a sink for C between 8 (NEE of -189 to -52Â gÂ CÂ m-2) and 10 (NEE of -185 to -48Â gÂ CÂ m-2) years following harvest.",

Since the root-derived CO2 is not part of soil C loss, it is worth estimating this fraction and determining its driving forces. In order to determine the dependency of the root respiration on recent photosynthates in a European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) stand in Southern Switzerland, we girdled 104 tree stems on an area of 625Â m2 at the end of August. The response of forest girdling on the below-ground C cycle was assessed by measuring soil respiration, soil microbial carbon biomass and root composition during the 37 days of experiment.Recent photosynthates contributed significantly to the soil respiration, which declined by 22 and up to 36% on average after girdling. The difference in soil respiration between girdled and control plots was significant only during a short time period (9-20 days after girdling). A significant decline in soil respiration was observed up to a distance of 4Â m from the stems. Fine roots from girdled trees were strongly depleted in starch (-90%), although they were functional as shown by the dehydrogenase test. We assume that a large fraction of the starch loss was most likely respired and contributed to the soil respiration or there was a decline in new starch supply due to reduced carbon allocation to the roots.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the recovery of species composition, diversity (Shannon's H'), and aboveground biomass in secondary forests that were abandoned after swidden cultivation for more than 20 years. A census of trees in secondary forest abandoned after upland rice cultivation or poppy cultivation and in uncultivated forest stands was conducted in a Karen village in Doi Inthanon National Park. Castanopsis acuminatissima and other Fagaceae species were the dominant species in uncultivated forest stands, while Schima wallichii was the most dominant species in secondary forest stands. The dominance of S. wallichii, Machilus bombycia, and Eurya acuminate var. wallichiana was higher in stands that had experienced poppy cultivation, resulting in the lower species diversity. Aboveground biomass in stands abandoned after upland cultivation with no history of poppy cultivation was higher than in stands that had a history of poppy cultivation. This is probably because tree stumps, which act as reservoirs for rapid recovery, were left after abandonment of upland rice cultivation. Cluster analysis revealed three different stand groups, based on presence/absence data of each species. Stands used only for upland rice cultivation were found in the stand group characterized by Fagaceae species, while stands abandoned after poppy cultivation and stands abandoned after upland rice cultivation that were located in the area where poppy had been cultivated in the past tended to be included in the stand group characterized by E. acuminate var. wallichiana. The species presence/absence composition results in stands with a history of poppy cultivation show that these areas take more time to reach climax species composition.",

Environmental and anthropogenic influences on forest structure in Larix decidua Mill. stands were investigated in two watersheds of the central Italian Alps (Valtellina, SO). We related three data sets (forest structure, anthropogenic influences, and topography) using ordination methods. Path models of correlative and causal relationships between these sets of variables were developed and used to differentiate the two watersheds with respect to levels of historical human influence. The two study areas (Musella and Ventina) were characterized by strong climatic and topographic gradients as well as a long history of human settlement, although historical intensity of agricultural activities was much greater for Musella. We hypothesized a weaker influence of abiotic variables on forest structure where the intensity of the primary human disturbance factors, forest thinning and cattle grazing, had been strongest.Stand structure types varied from sparse, larch-dominated forests at high elevations, to denser stands at lower elevations dominated by spruce. Correlations of environmental variables with dominant trends in stand structure were low with the exception of elevation. Anthropogenic variables were unimportant at Ventina, whereas the interactive effects of both anthropogenic and abiotic variables were needed to explain stand structure in Musella. The best-fit model indicated a negative effect of elevation and anthropogenic variables on overall tree size. Stands with greater tree density and canopy height layer diversity were located further from roads. Both watersheds were characterized by a strong dominance of larch stands, but their structure and spatial pattern differed greatly. Sparse larch forests were exclusively associated with moraines and upper elevations at Ventina, but were also common near low-elevation farms at Musella. Historical human influences were difficult to measure and may play a greater role in determining forest structure than was suggested. Our study emphasizes the importance of landscape context for interpreting the relative strengths of anthropogenic and abiotic influences on stand development pathways.",

Measured mean stocks and calculated median turnover times of soil C ranged from 4.4 to 12.2Â kg C m-Â 2 and 11 to 31Â years, respectively. The predicted turnover times reflect a high proportion of labile soil C over the selected sampling depth. Both forest soil C stocks and the predicted turnover time of soil C increased with altitude. There were no consistent trends for stand basal area and forest soil C inputs along the elevation gradient suggesting that altitudinal changes in soil C stocks and turnover times could be attributed to different rates of soil organic matter decomposition. Soil respiration flux did not vary significantly with altitude, but soil respiration normalized for existing soil C stocks indicated decreasing rates of soil organic matter decomposition with increasing elevation. Measured soil N stocks and differences in O-horizon litter chemistry indicated increasing N availability from low-elevation to high-elevation forests. Soil C storage and turnover time increased from warmer, drier, less N-rich forests to colder, wetter, more N-rich forests. Considered together, these data support assumptions of a declining rate of soil organic matter decomposition with increasing elevation in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Representative characterization of long-term litter C inputs is one of the most challenging aspects of the present analysis.",

Wedeveloped a below-ground carbon (C) budget forwell-drained soils in Harvard Forest Massachusetts, anecosystem that is storing C. Measurements of carbonand radiocarbon (14C) inventory were used todetermine the turnover time and maximum rate ofCO2 production from heterotrophic respiration ofthree fractions of soil organic matter (SOM):recognizable litter fragments (L), humified lowdensity material (H), and high density ormineral-associated organic matter (M). Turnover timesin all fractions increased with soil depth and were2-5 years for recognizable leaf litter, 5-10 years forroot litter, 40-100+ years for low density humifiedmaterial and >100 years for carbon associated withminerals. These turnover times represent the timecarbon resides in the plant + soil system, and mayunderestimate actual decomposition rates if carbonresides for several years in living root, plant orwoody material.Soil respiration was partitioned into two componentsusing 14C: recent photosynthate which ismetabolized by roots and microorganisms within a yearof initial fixation (Recent-C), and C that is respiredduring microbial decomposition of SOM that resides inthe soil for several years or longer (Reservoir-C).For the whole soil, we calculate that decomposition ofReservoir-C contributes approximately 41% of thetotal annual soil respiration. Of this 41%,recognizable leaf or root detritus accounts for 80%of the flux, and 20% is from the more humifiedfractions that dominate the soil carbon stocks.Measurements of CO2 and 14CO2 in thesoil atmosphere and in total soil respiration werecombined with surface CO2 fluxes and a soil gasdiffusion model to determine the flux and isotopicsignature of C produced as a function of soil depth. 63% of soil respiration takes place in the top 15 cmof the soil (O + A + Ap horizons). The average residencetime of Reservoir-C in the plant + soil system is8Â±1 years and the average age of carbon in totalsoil respiration (Recent-C + Reservoir-C) is 4Â±1years.The O and A horizons have accumulated 4.4 kgC m-2above the plow layer since abandonment by settlers inthe late-1800's. C pools contributing the most to soilrespiration have short enough turnover times that theyare likely in steady state. However, most C is storedas humified organic matter within both the O and Ahorizons and has turnover times from 40 to 100+ yearsrespectively. These reservoirs continue to accumulatecarbon at a combined rate of 10-30 gC mminus 2yr-1. This rate of accumulation is only 5-15% of the total ecosystem C sink measured in this stand using eddy covariance methods.",

Our main objective was to investigate the influence of long-term variations of environmental and biological variables on component-specific and whole-ecosystem respiration (Re) processes. During the study period, the stand was exposed to severe drought conditions that affected much of the western plains of North America. Over the 3 years, daily mean Rs varied from a minimum of 0.1Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 during winter to a maximum of 9.2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in mid-summer. Seasonal variations of Rs were highly correlated with variations of soil temperature (Ts) and water content (<U+03B8>) in the surface soil layers. Both variables explained 96, 95 and 90% of the variance in daily mean Rs from 2001 to 2003. Aspen daily mean Rb varied from negligible during winter to a maximum of 2.5Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â barkÂ s-1 (2.2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â groundÂ s-1) during the growing season. Maximum Rb occurred at the end of the aspen radial growth increment and leaf emergence period during each year. This was 2 months before the peak in bole temperature (Tb) in 2001 and 2003. Nonetheless, Rb was highly correlated with Tb and this variable explained 77, 87 and 62% of the variance in Rb in the respective years. Partitioning of Rb between its maintenance (Rbm) and growth (Rbg) components using the mature tissue method showed that daily mean Rbg occurred at the same time as aspen radial growth increment during each growing season. This method led, however, to systematic over- and underestimations of Rbm and Rbg, respectively, during each year. Annual totals of Rs, Rb and estimated foliage respiration (Rf) from hazelnut and aspen trees were, on average, 829, 159 and 202Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1, respectively, over the 3 years. These totals corresponded to 70, 14 and 16%, respectively, of scaled-up respiration estimates of Re from chamber measurements. Scaled Re estimates were 25% higher (1190Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1) than the annual totals of Re obtained from EC (949Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1). The independent effects of temperature and drought on annual totals of Re and its components were difficult to separate because the two variables co-varied during the 3 years. However, recalculation of annual totals of Rs to remove the limitations imposed by low <U+03B8>, suggests that drought played a more important role than temperature in explaining interannual variations of Rs and Re.",

Daily mean Rs varied from a minimum of 0.1Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in February to a maximum of 9.2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in mid-July. Daily mean Ts at the 2-cm depth was the primary variable accounting for the temporal variation of Rs and no differences between Arrhenius and Q10 response functions were found to describe the seasonal relationship. Rs at 10Â Â°C (Rs10) and the temperature sensitivity of Rs (Q10Rs) calculated at the seasonal time scale were 3.8Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and 3.8, respectively. Temperature normalization of daily mean Rs (RsN) revealed that <U+03B8> in the 0-15Â cm soil layer was the secondary variable accounting for the temporal variation of Rs during the growing season. Daily RsN showed two distinctive phases with respect to soil water field capacity in the 0-15Â cm layer (<U+03B8>fc, ~0.30Â m3Â m-3): (1) RsN was strongly reduced when <U+03B8> decreased below <U+03B8>fc, which reflected a reduction in microbial decomposition, and (2) RsN slightly decreased when <U+03B8> increased above <U+03B8>fc, which reflected a restriction of CO2 or O2 transport in the soil profile.Diurnal variations of half-hourly Rs were usually out of phase with Ts at the 2-cm depth, which resulted in strong diurnal hysteresis between the two variables. Daily nighttime Rs10 and Q10Rs parameters calculated from half-hourly nighttime measurements of Rs and Ts at the 2-cm depth (when there was steady cooling of the soil) varied greatly during the growing season and ranged from 6.8 to 1.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and 5.5 to 1.3, respectively. On average, daily nighttime Rs10 (4.5Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1) and Q10Rs (2.8) were higher and lower, respectively, than the values obtained from the seasonal relationship. Seasonal variations of these daily parameters were highly correlated with variations of <U+03B8> in the 0-15Â cm soil layer, with a tendency of low Rs10 and Q10Rs values at low <U+03B8>. Overall, the use of seasonal Rs10 and Q10Rs parameters led to an overestimation of daily ranges of half-hourly Rs (<U+0394>Rs) during drought conditions, which supported findings that the short-term temperature sensitivity of Rs was lower during periods of low <U+03B8>. The use of daily nighttime Rs10 and Q10Rs parameters greatly helped at simulating <U+0394>Rs during these periods but did not improve the estimation of half-hourly Rs throughout the year as it could not account for the diurnal hysteresis effect.",

The stands were exposed to similar climate forcing in 2003, including marked seasonal variations in soil water availability, which provided a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of climate and stand characteristics on soil CO2 efflux and to quantify its contribution to the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) as measured with the eddy-covariance technique. Partitioning of soil CO2 efflux between soil respiration (including forest-floor vegetation) and forest-floor photosynthesis showed that short- and long-term temporal variations of soil CO2 efflux were related to the influence of (1) soil temperature and water content on soil respiration and (2) below-canopy light availability, plant water status and forest-floor plant species composition on forest-floor photosynthesis. Overall, the three stands were weak to moderate sinks for CO2 in 2003 (NEE of -103, -80 and -28 g C m-2 yr-1 for aspen, black spruce and jack pine, respectively). Forest-floor respiration accounted for 86%, 73% and 75% of annual ecosystem respiration, in the three respective stands, while forest-floor photosynthesis contributed to 11% and 14% of annual gross ecosystem photosynthesis in the black spruce and jack pine stands, respectively. The results emphasize the need to perform concomitant measurements of NEE and soil CO2 efflux at longer time scales in different ecosystems in order to better understand the impacts of future interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics associated with climate change on each component of the carbon balance.

The importance of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S and a mixture of micronutrients was tested in a minus-one-trial by comparison with a full complement of nutrients and unfertilized control plots. Fertilizers were applied three times during the experiment and their effects were monitored over 2 1/2 years. Prior to the second fertilization, one third of each experimental plot was cleared of the vegetation cover and planted in maize, prior to the third fertilizer application these subplots were planted in sorghum. Biomass of maize and sorghum were used to indicate nutrient constraints and fertilizing effects due to the different treatments. Both crops were limited by P- and N-availability, with greater responses to P. The initial fertilization did not affect the biomass accumulation of the secondary vegetation during the first 15 months, but two additional applications significantly increased biomass in the complete fertilizer treatment compared to the unfertilized control. Biomass accumulation was primarily P-limited, N-limitation was apparent but not significant. The remaining nutrients did not affect plant growth. Fertilization favored production of nutrient-rich leaves. Application of readily available nutrients gave grasses a competitive edge over slower reacting woody vegetation. Fertilization also caused significant shifts in the contribution of woody species to biomass accumulation, as could be demonstrated for two prominent pioneer tree species. Growth response to fertilization as well as the primary limiting nutrient varied among seven dominant species monitored in the secondary vegetation. We conclude that growth of tropical secondary vegetation can be nutrient limited and it might respond significantly to additional nutrients by increasing biomass production.",

Goodness of fit of the allometric equations that emerged was similar whether diameter- or length-based (both R2=0.73 for mixed-species regressions). The diameter is therefore recommended as single biomass estimator. Using both, diameter and length as estimators, the R2 increased to 0.91 for mixed-species. Neither the forest type nor the number of shoots per plant individual affected the allometric relationships. With few exceptions, species-specific equations were similar and goodness of fit increased only moderately over mixed-species equations. The mixed-species equations presented here were valid over a wide range of environments and species compositions, and are recommended for the non-destructive estimation of liana biomass in tropical forests and bushlands.",

Biomass accumulated in the form of a saturation curve: 25 y of regrowth restored half of the mature-forest biomass, 75% would be restored after an estimated 175 y. Biomass accumulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in woody plant density and an increase of the positive skew of plant size distribution. Liana biomass share declined from 5.0% in young to 1.9% in old regrowth, and 1.3% in mature forest, whereas the share of palms was low (0.5%) in young regrowth and high in old regrowth (1.8%) and mature forest (2.2%). 25-y-old regrowth was similar with mature forest in respect to woody plant density and growth-form composition, but both the plant size distribution and the number of stems per plant differed strongly from mature forest. A moderate increase in land use had only minor effects on biomass accumulation, but profoundly changed structural characteristics of regrowth, pointing to a high vulnerability to degradation. Thus, the sustainability of slash-and-burn in central Amazonia may be lower than the rapid initial biomass accumulation would make it seem.",

We partitioned total fine-root respiration (RT) between maintenance (RM), growth (RG), and N uptake respiration (RN) for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) forests exposed to elevated CO2. â€¢ A substantial increase in fine-root production contributed to a 151% increase in RG for loblolly pine in elevated CO2.

Maintenance respiration was the vast majority of RT, and contributed 92% and 86% of these totals at the pine and sweetgum forests, respectively. â€¢ The hypothesis was rejected because the majority of fine-root respiration was used for maintenance and was not reduced by changes in root N concentration in elevated CO2. Because of its large contribution to RT and total soil CO2 efflux, changes in RM caused by warming may greatly alter carbon losses from forests to the atmosphere. ",

However, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon logging and ground fires degrade forest structure and create land cover types that are intermediate between intact and cleared forest. The objective of this study was to provide a basis for understanding the implications of forest degradation by comparing the impacts of varying intensities of logging and fire on forest structure and composition. Field inventories in forests whose impacts ranged from none to logged and heavily burned were conducted in 14, 10mx500m plots located on 10 properties in the region of Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Live aboveground biomass of intact forest was estimated at 309Â tÂ ha-1. Following moderate intensity logging (35Â m3Â ha-1 removed), this value was decreased by 20%, but a 48% reduction was observed following high intensity logging (69Â m3Â ha-1 removed). Light burning of moderately logged forest resulted in a total biomass reduction equal to that of high intensity logging whereas moderately logged and heavily burned forest had 83% less live biomass than intact forest. Recovery of pre-degradation biomass and forest structure is likely to be impeded by abundant lianas and the high incidence of crown and stem damage in the residual stands. Although burning killed the majority of large diameter woody vines, increase in the abundance of lianas <1Â cm diameter, (mean stem density 4100Â ha-1 in lightly burned stands and 9355Â ha-1 in heavily burned), more than compensated for these losses in terms of total liana density. In addition, increased amounts of coarse woody debris and greatly reduced canopy cover in both heavily logged and heavily burned forests have increased the risk of future fires that could further degraded these forests. As more and more logging frontiers in the eastern Brazilian Amazon mature it is likely that repeated logging of previously logged stands will become more common. This combined with the increased flammability of previously burned stands is likely to result in the spread of forest degradation unless incentives can be developed to encourage the use of low impact logging techniques and the development of cost effective fire prevention methods.",

The difficulty of directly measuring total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) has limited our understanding of belowground carbon (C) cycling and the factors that control this important flux. We measured TBCA over 4 years using a conservation of mass, C balance approach in replicate stands of fast growing Eucalyptus saligna Smith with different nutrition management and tree density treatments. We measured TBCA as surface carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux (â€œsoilâ€ respiration) minus C inputs from aboveground litter plus the change in C stored in roots, litter, and soil. We evaluated this C balance approach to measuring TBCA by examining (a) the variance in TBCA across replicate plots; (b) cumulative error associated with summing components to arrive at our estimates of TBCA; (c) potential sources of error in the techniques and assumptions; (d) the magnitude of changes in C stored in soil, litter, and roots compared to TBCA; and (e) the sensitivity of our measures of TBCA to differences in nutrient availability, tree density, and forest age. The C balance method gave precise estimates of TBCA and reflected differences in belowground allocation expected with manipulations of fertility and tree density. Across treatments, TBCA averaged 1.88 kg C m-2 y-1 and was 18% higher in plots planted with 104 trees/ha compared to plots planted with 1111 trees/ha. TBCA was 12% lower (but not significantly so) in fertilized plots. For all treatments, TBCA declined linearly with stand age. The coefficient of variation (CV) for TBCA for replicate plots averaged 17%. Averaged across treatments and years, annual changes in C stored in soil, the litter layer, and coarse roots (-0.01, 0.06, and 0.21 kg C m-2 y-1, respectively) were small compared with surface CO2 efflux (2.03 kg C m-2 y-1), aboveground litterfall (0.42 kg C m-2 y-1), and our estimated TBCA (1.88 kg C m-2 y-1). Based on studies from similar sites, estimates of losses of C through leaching, erosion, or storage of C in deep soil were less than 1% of annual TBCA. ",

Alternatively, increases in nutrient supply may increase GPP, with the quantity of GPP allocated aboveground increasing more steeply than the quantity of GPP allocated belowground. To examine the effects of an elevated nutrient supply on the C allocation patterns in forests, we determined whole-ecosystem C budgets in unfertilized plots of Eucalyptus saligna and in adjacent plots receiving regular additions of 65 kg N ha-1, 31 kg P ha-1, 46 kg K ha-1, and macro- and micronutrients. We measured the absolute flux of C allocated to the components of GPP (ANPP, TBCA and APR), as well as the fraction of GPP allocated to these components. Fertilization dramatically increased GPP. Averaged over 3 years, GPP in the fertilized plots was 34% higher than that in the unfertilized controls (3.95 vs. 2.95 kg C m-2 yr-1). Fertilization-related increases in GPP were allocated entirely aboveground - ANPP was 85% higher and APR was 57% higher in the fertilized than in the control plots, while TBCA did not differ significantly between treatments. Carbon use efficiency (NPP/GPP) was slightly higher in the fertilized (0.53) compared with the control plots (0.51). Overall, fertilization increased ANPP and APR, and these increases were related to a greater GPP and an increase in the fraction of GPP allocated aboveground. ",

The humid tropics exert a disproportionately large influence over terrestrial C storage, but C allocation and belowground retention in these ecosystems remain poorly quantified. Using mass balance and 13C isotope methods, we examined the effects of afforestation and fertilization, two land-use changes of large-scale importance, on belowground C cycling at a humid tropical site in Hawaii. Here we report that in unfertilized plots, 80% of the C allocated belowground by trees to roots and mycorrhizae was returned to the atmosphere within 1Â year; 9% of the belowground C flux was retained in coarse roots and 11% was retained as new soil C. The gains in new soil C were offset entirely by losses of old soil C. Further, while fertilization early in stand development increased C storage in the litter layer and in coarse roots, it reduced by 22% the flux of C moving through roots and mycorrhizae into mineral soils. Because soil C formation rates related strongly to rhizosphere C flux, fertilization may reduce an already limited capacity of these forests to sequester decay-resistant soil C.",

We evaluated the C balance of a recently harvested boreal site in eastern Canada by measuring CO2 fluxes with the eddy covariance technique for 1 year before the application of a scarification treatment (mechanical site preparation) and for 1 year after the treatment was applied to approximately 40% of the study area. Net annual exchange indicated a source of 111Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 before scarification that increased to 175Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 after treatment. Annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and net C flux varied between years, but there was no significant difference for ecosystem respiration. Since the differences in climate between years did not explain the changes in the site C balance and daytime net C sequestration under non-limiting environmental conditions was generally lower after the treatment, the large difference in C emissions was most likely due to decreased GEP resulting from the destruction of approximately 60% of the living aboveground vegetation within the scarified areas. Although daily NEP was almost always negative throughout the year, a net daily C sink was observed during a 2-week period in late summer 2003 when air temperatures were approximately 8Â Â°C cooler than preceding weeks. An analysis of the residuals from light-response regressions showed that soil water content and vapor pressure deficit were the second most important variables explaining morning and afternoon net C flux in 2003 and 2004, respectively.",

We also used 24 site-years of eddy-covariance measurements from two Harvard Forest sites to examine the relationship between soil and ecosystem respiration (Re). Rs was highly variable at all spatial (respiration collar to forest stand) and temporal (minutes to years) scales of measurement. The response of Rs to experimental manipulations mimicking aspects of global change or aimed at partitioning Rs into component fluxes ranged from -70% to +52%. The response appears to arise from variations in substrate availability induced by changes in the size of soil C pools and of belowground C fluxes or in environmental conditions. In some cases (e.g., logging, warming), the effect of experimental manipulations on Rs was transient, but in other cases the time series were not long enough to rule out long-term changes in respiration rates. Inter-annual variations in weather and phenology induced variation among annual Rs estimates of a magnitude similar to that of other drivers of global change (i.e., invasive insects, forest management practices, N deposition). At both eddy-covariance sites, aboveground respiration dominated Re early in the growing season, whereas belowground respiration dominated later. Unusual aboveground respiration patterns-high apparent rates of respiration during winter and very low rates in mid-to-late summer-at the Environmental Measurement Site suggest either bias in Rs and Re estimates caused by differences in the spatial scale of processes influencing fluxes, or that additional research on the hard-to-measure fluxes (e.g., wintertime Rs, unaccounted losses of CO2 from eddy covariance sites), daytime and nighttime canopy respiration and its impacts on estimates of Re, and independent measurements of flux partitioning (e.g., aboveground plant respiration, isotopic partitioning) may yield insight into the unusually high and low fluxes. Overall, however, this data-rich analysis identifies important seasonal and experimental variations in Rs and Re and in the partitioning of Re above- vs. belowground. ",

Partitioning of extra carbon (C) among C pools of different turnover rates is of critical interest; thus, we calculated net ecosystem productivity (NEP) to determine whether elevated atmospheric [CO2] will enhance net plantation C storage capacity. Free-air CO2 enrichment increased net primary productivity (NPP) of all genotypes by 21% in the second year and by 26% in the third year, mainly because of an increase in the size of C pools with relatively slow turnover rates (i.e., wood). In all genotypes in the FACE treatment, more new soil C was added to the total soil C pool compared with the control treatment. However, more old soil C loss was observed in the FACE treatment compared with the control treatment, possibly due to a priming effect from newly incorporated root litter. FACE did not significantly increase NEP, probably as a result of this priming effect.",

Fine root biomass values increased from 1.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 4.95 Â± 0.62 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m, reaching a maximum of 6.83 Â± 1.13 Mg C ha-1 at the 2020 m elevation site. Aboveground biomass values decreased from 123.50 Mg C ha-1 at 194 m to 47.03 Mg C ha-1 at 3020 m. Mean annual belowground productivity was highest in the most fertile lowland plots (7.40 Â± 1.00 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and ranged between 3.43 Â± 0.73 and 1.48 Â± 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the premontane and montane plots. Mean annual aboveground productivity was estimated to vary between 9.50 Â± 1.08 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (210 m) and 2.59 Â± 0.40 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (2020 m), with consistently lower values observed in the cloud immersion zone of the montane forest. Fine root C residence time increased from 0.31 years in lowland Amazonia to 3.78 Â± 0.81 years at 3020 m and stem C residence time remained constant along the elevational transect, with a mean of 54 Â± 4 years. The ratio of fine root biomass to stem biomass increased significantly with increasing elevation, whereas the allocation of net primary productivity above- and belowground remained approximately constant at all elevations. Although net primary productivity declined in the TMF, the partitioning of productivity between the ecosystem subcomponents remained the same in lowland, premontane and montane forests. ",

We investigated the effects of soil fertility and disturbance on plant-soil interactions and nutrient cycling in a diverse tropical rainforest. Our goal was to determine how common soil specialisation is among species and how plant-soil interactions affect ecosystem functioning in the presence of disturbance. Most species (59%) showed significant fidelity to either fertile (basalt) or infertile (schist) soils. Obligate schist specialists (six species) contributed 39 and 37% to total stand-level basal area and aboveground net primary productivity, respectively. High nutrient use efficiency of schist specialists reduced the rates of within-stand nutrient cycling through the production of nutrient-poor plant tissues and litter. Although forests on schist soils had higher basal area and similar rates of productivity to forests on basalt, uptake of Mg, K, P, and N were markedly less on schist than on basalt, particularly after a cyclone disturbance. Stands on schist soils were also less affected by the cyclone and, as a result, contributed less (ca. 50%) Mg, K, P, and N inputs to the forest floor (via litterfall) than stands on basalt soils. System â€œopennessâ€ (i.e. the risk of nutrient loss) from cyclone-affected basalt forests was minimised by high rates of uptake following disturbance and large effective cation exchange capacities of soils. Soil-plant-disturbance interactions are likely to engender different fitness-enhancing strategies on fertile and infertile soils, possibly leading to the development and/or maintenance of diversity in rainforests.",

In the forest bogs, the differences related to the microrelief were significantly lower. In the areas with the ridge-pool microrelief, the weighted average (for 3 years) CO2 emission was 436 g C/m2 per year; in the better drained natural dwarf shrub-cotton grass-sphagnum pine forest, 930; and in the drained pine forest, 1292 g C/m2 per year. The share of the CO2 amount emitted in the cold period (November-April) amounted to 10% of its annual flux from the peat soils of the ridge-pool complex and 17 and 24%, respectively, in the natural and drained pine forests.",

Here, we use a unique data set of mortality in a temperate deciduous forest to characterize rates and drivers of mortality. At the 25.6-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science-Forest Global Earth Observatory forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (Virginia, USA), we conducted two full tree censuses in 2008 and 2013 and then tracked mortality over the next 2Â years (2014 and 2015). Overall, the mortality rate, m, of stems =10Â cm diameter was 1.3-2.1%/yr. Biomass mortality, M, was 1.9-3.4Â MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 at the stand level (0.6-1.1%/yr of biomass), less than biomass gains from growth and recruitment, resulting in net live biomass accumulation. Small stems died at the highest rate; however, contributions to M increased toward larger size classes. Most species had mÂ <Â 2%/yr and MÂ <Â 0.25Â MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 (<3%/yr of biomass), whereas two to four species had anomalously high mortality rates during each census period, accounting for 15-24% of m (nÂ =Â 2, Cercis canadensis, Ulmus species) and 39-75% of M (nÂ =Â 4 Quercus species). Stems that died, whether or not in association with mechanical damage, tended to grow more slowly in preceding years than surviving stems and, for certain shade-intolerant species, tended to be in neighborhoods with higher basal area. These findings show how relatively fine-scale mortality processes contribute to stand-level compositional change and carbon cycling. The mortality patterns reported here will provide a valuable basis for understanding future disturbance events within eastern deciduous forests and for comparing across forest types. ",

The effect of stand age on Fs was examined using a replicated chronosequence approach in which stands ranging from 1 to 25Â years since planting were investigated. Soil CO2 efflux was measured on both VA and SC sites for over a year using a closed dynamic system. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate Fs correlates and examine the relationship between candidate explanatory variables and Fs. Soil temperature (top 10Â cm) was the major correlate with Fs on both locations. We observed a positive age effect on Fs in VA stands and no relationship between age and Fs in SC stands. Annual soil C efflux declined with stand age in SC due to both reductions in soil temperatures as crown closure occurs and a diminishing heterotrophic C substrate pool. Annual estimated efflux ranges from 16.7 to 13.2Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 for 1 and 20-year-old stands, respectively. In contrast, annual soil C efflux increased with age in VA stands as a result of the positive relationship between stand age and Fs, which appears to be related to an increase in the contribution of root respiration to total Fs over time. In VA stands, efflux estimates range from 7.6 to 12.3Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 for 1 and 20-year-old stands, respectively. These results demonstrate the need to further consider the impact forest management and within-region variability have on soil C efflux over time when estimating C budgets.",

Measurements of the annual production of above- and below-ground live and dead mass, foliar herbivory, and soil respiration were used to develop biometric estimates of NEP (NEPB). Eddy-covariance measurements made above the canopy were used to construct meteorological estimates of NEP (NEPM). Over the 5-year study period, C stored annually in live mass (above- and below-ground wood) averaged 2.13Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1, while annual detritus production (fine roots, leaf litter, woody debris) averaged 4.35Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1.

When annual NEPB and NEPM were compared in a given year, they differed from each other by 13-148%. However, when compared over 5 years, these independent estimates of C storage converged to within 1% of each other. Differences between same-year biometric and meteorological NEP estimates were explained in part by a lag between late-season net canopy photosynthesis and C allocated to tree growth the following spring. Weekly assessments of bole radial growth in 2001 and 2002 indicated that woody mass growth began prior to positive net canopy photosynthesis in the spring and that >25% of annual photosynthetic C assimilation occurred after growth had stopped in the autumn. Thus, while the temporal separation between photosynthesis and growth reduced agreement between annual NEPB and NEPM estimates, these metrics converged over several years. These results suggest that the allocation of recent photosynthate to storage carbohydrates, rather than to immediate growth, may obscure the relationship between shorter term, annual biometric and meteorological C storage estimates. Moreover, the 5-year convergence of biometric and meteorological NEP estimates serves as an important cross-validation, demonstrating that both approaches can yield accurate forest C storage assessments.",

Maximum annual C storage in stands that were disturbed by harvest and fire twice was 26% less than a reference stand receiving the same disturbance only once. The mechanism for this reduction in annual C storage was a long-lasting decrease in site quality that endured over the 62-year timeframe examined. However, during regrowth the harvested and burned forest rapidly became a net C sink, storing 0.53 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 after 6 years. Maximum net ecosystem production (1.35 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and annual C increment (0.95 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) were recorded in the 24- and 50-year-old stands, respectively. Net primary production averaged 5.19 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in experimental stands, increasing by < 10% from 6 to 50 years. Soil heterotrophic respiration was more variable across stand ages, ranging from 3.85 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the 6-year-old stand to 4.56 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the 68-year-old stand. These results suggest that harvesting and fire disturbances broadly distributed across the region decades ago caused changes in site quality and successional status that continue to limit forest C storage rates.

Measurements of the annual production of above- and below-ground live and dead mass, foliar herbivory, and soil respiration were used to develop biometric estimates of NEP (NEPB). Eddy-covariance measurements made above the canopy were used to construct meteorological estimates of NEP (NEPM). Over the 5-year study period, C stored annually in live mass (above- and below-ground wood) averaged 2.13Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1, while annual detritus production (fine roots, leaf litter, woody debris) averaged 4.35Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1. Fine root inputs were the largest component (41%) of annual net primary production.The forest was a consistent C sink, with annual NEP ranging from 0.80 to 1.98Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1, comparable in magnitude to other eastern North American forests. When annual NEPB and NEPM were compared in a given year, they differed from each other by 13-148%. However, when compared over 5 years, these independent estimates of C storage converged to within 1% of each other. Differences between same-year biometric and meteorological NEP estimates were explained in part by a lag between late-season net canopy photosynthesis and C allocated to tree growth the following spring. Weekly assessments of bole radial growth in 2001 and 2002 indicated that woody mass growth began prior to positive net canopy photosynthesis in the spring and that >25% of annual photosynthetic C assimilation occurred after growth had stopped in the autumn. Thus, while the temporal separation between photosynthesis and growth reduced agreement between annual NEPB and NEPM estimates, these metrics converged over several years. These results suggest that the allocation of recent photosynthate to storage carbohydrates, rather than to immediate growth, may obscure the relationship between shorter term, annual biometric and meteorological C storage estimates. Moreover, the 5-year convergence of biometric and meteorological NEP estimates serves as an important cross-validation, demonstrating that both approaches can yield accurate forest C storage assessments.",

Carbon sequestration was higher than average in 1991 because of increased photosynthesis and in 1995 because of decreased respiration. Interannual shifts in photosynthesis were associated with the timing of leaf expansion and senescence. Shifts in annual respiration were associated with anomalies in soil temperature, deep snow in winter, and drought in summer. If this ecosystem is typical of northern biomes, interannual climate variations on seasonal time scales may modify annual CO2 exchange in the Northern Hemisphere by 1 gigaton of carbon or more each year.",

Live biomass (Clive) was low in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, and increased following a logistic pattern to high levels in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Carbon stocks in the forest floor (Cforest floor) and coarse woody debris (CCWD) were comparatively high in the 1-year-old stand, reduced in the 6- through 40-year-old stands, and highest in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Total net primary production (TNPP) was reduced in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, highest in the 23- through 74-year-old stands and somewhat reduced in the 154-year-old stand. The NPP decline at the 154-year-old stand was related to increased autotrophic respiration rather than decreased gross primary production (GPP). Net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated by integrated eddy covariance, indicated the 1- and 6-year-old stands were losing carbon, the 15-year-old stand was gaining a small amount of carbon, the 23- and 74-year-old stands were gaining considerable carbon, and the 40- and 154-year-old stands were gaining modest amounts of carbon. The recovery from fire was rapid; a linear fit through the NEP observations at the 6- and 15-year-old stands indicated the transition from carbon source to sink occurred within 11-12 years. The NEP decline at the 154-year-old stand appears related to increased losses from Clive by tree mortality and possibly from Cforest floor by decomposition. Our findings support the idea that NPP, carbon production efficiency (NPP/GPP), NEP, and carbon storage efficiency (NEP/TNPP) all decrease in old boreal stands. ",

Direct estimates of leaf area index, defined as one half of the total leaf surface area, range from a minimum of 1.8 for jack pine forests to a maximum of 5.6 for black spruce forests; stems comprise 5 to 15% of the total overstory plant area. In the BOREAS study, total ecosystem (vegetation plus detritus plus soil) carbon content is greatest in the black spruce forests (445,760-479,380 kg C ha-1), with 87 to 88% of the C in the soil, and is lowest in the jack pine stands (68,370-68,980 kg C ha-1) with a similar distribution of carbon in the vegetation and soil. Forest floor carbon content and mean residence time (MRT) also vary more among forest types in a study area than between study areas for a forest type; forest floor MRT range from 16 to 19 years for aspen stands to 28 to 39 years for jack pine stands. ANPP differs significantly among the mature forests at each of the BOREAS study areas, ranging from a maximum of 3490 to 3520 kg C ha-1 yr-1 for aspen stands to 1170 to 1220 kg C ha-1 yr-1 for jack pine stands. Both net primary production (NPP) and carbon allocation differ between boreal evergreen and deciduous forests in the world, suggesting global primary production models should distinguish between these two forest types.

Twenty-four Class I stands (complete NPP budgets) and 45 Class II boreal forest stands (aboveground NPP [NPPA] and budget only) were identified. The geographic distribution of the Class I stands was not uniform; 46% of the stands were from two studies in North America, and only one stand was from the important larch forests of Eurasia. Total (above- and belowground) net primary production (NPPT) ranged from 52 to 868 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 and averaged 424 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1. NPPA was consistently larger for deciduous than for evergreen boreal forests in each of the major boreal regions, especially for boreal forests in Alaska. Belowground net primary production:total net primary production (NPPB : NPPT) ratios were consistently larger for evergreen (0.36) than deciduous (0.19) boreal forests. NPP of different-aged stands in age sequence varied from 44% to 77%, a magnitude equal to or greater than that of climatic factors or vegetation type. NPP and NPPA were positively correlated (r2 = 0.66-0.68) to mean annual aboveground increment for Class I stands, and this empirical relationship explained 81% of the observed variation of NPPA for Class II stands. These robust relationships provide an approach for increasing the number and spatial coverage of boreal forest NPP data needed to evaluate NPP estimates from ecosystem models. Notable deficiencies of boreal forest NPP data were ground layer vegetation and belowground NPP data, NPP data for boreal forest age sequences, and NPP data for boreal larch ecosystems in Eurasia.

This, in turn, has led to apparent decreases in decomposition, net N mineralization, and soil respiration (i.e., net soil CO2 efflux) rates, losses of floral and faunal diversity, and greater risk of the occurrence of stand-replacing wildfire. Alterations in ecosystem structure and function have prompted the implementation of restoration treatments throughout the region. Using a retrospective approach, we investigated the effects of thinning, thinning plus prescribed fire, and wildfire, 6-15 years following treatments, on ecosystem processes and properties across a 750-km2 area in northern Arizona. We found that stands that had thinning or thinning plus burning treatments had lower in situ annual rates of net N mineralization in the mineral soil than unmanaged stands. However, stands burned by high-severity wildfire had net N mineralization rates that were about 60% higher than unmanaged stands. Because of similarities in net N mineralization rates among treatments under laboratory conditions, we speculate that variation in in situ net N transformation rates among stands were due to differences in C inputs (thinned and thinned plus burned) and soil microclimate (wildfire) among the stands. Size of the soil microbial C and N pools generally declined with decreases in litterfall (highest in unmanaged, intermediate in thinned and thinned plus burned, and lowest in wildfire stands); however, in situ rates of net soil CO2 efflux did not follow this pattern. Our results contrast with some previous studies in southwestern ponderosa pine forests where restoration treatments (both thinning and thinning plus burning) increased net N transformation rates. We hypothesize that the dissimilarity in responses to treatments across studies is due to differences in the relative effect of these treatments on the quantity and quality of C inputs. Large increases in easily decomposable understory biomass following restoration treatments appear to result in increases in N cycling rates, whereas treatments that result in either no change or minimal increases in understory biomass, accompanied by a long-term decrease in pine needle input to the forest floor, lead to reductions in N cycling rates. We recommend that restoration and fire-hazard reduction treatments be applied preferentially to stands that currently have low understory production.",

In some areas, especially in Germany and France, it was the strongest drought for the last 50 years, lasting for more than 6 months.We used continuous carbon and water flux measurements at 12 European monitoring sites covering various forest ecosystem types and a large climatic range in order to characterise the consequences of this drought on ecosystems functioning.As soil water content in the root zone was only monitored in a few sites, a daily water balance model was implemented at each stand to estimate the water balance terms: trees and understorey transpiration, rainfall interception, throughfall, drainage in the different soil layers and soil water content. This model calculated the onset date, duration and intensity of the soil water shortage (called water stress) using measured climate and site properties: leaf area index and phenology that both determine tree transpiration and rainfall interception, soil characteristics and root distribution, both influencing water absorption and drainage. At sites where soil water content was measured, we observed a good agreement between measured and modelled soil water content.Our analysis showed a wide spatial distribution of drought stress over Europe, with a maximum intensity within a large band extending from Portugal to NE Germany.Vapour fluxes in all the investigated sites were reduced by drought, due to stomatal closure, when the relative extractable water in soil (REW) dropped below ca. 0.4. Rainfall events during the drought, however, typically induced rapid restoration of vapour fluxes.Similar to the water vapour fluxes, the net ecosystem production decreased with increasing water stress at all the sites. Both gross primary production (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (TER) also decreased when REW dropped below 0.4 and 0.2, for GPP and TER, respectively.A higher sensitivity to drought was found in the beech, and surprisingly, in the broadleaved Mediterranean forests; the coniferous stands (spruce and pine) appeared to be less drought-sensitive.The effect of drought on tree growth was also large at the three sites where the annual tree growth was measured. Especially in beech, this growth reduction was more pronounced in the year following the drought (2004). Such lag effects on tree growth should be considered an important feature in forest ecosystems, which may enhance vulnerability to more frequent climate extremes.",

The variability in NEE (coefficient of variation, CV = 44%) was related to both gross primary production (GPP) and to variations in total ecosystem respiration (TER), each term showing similar and lower interannual variability (CV = 14%) than NEE. Variation in the annual GPP was related to: (i) the water deficit duration and intensity cumulated over the growing season, and (ii) the growing season length, i.e. the period of carbon uptake by the stand. Two thinnings occurring during the observation period did not provoke a reduction in either GPP, water fluxes, or in tree growth. Interannual variation of TER could not be explained by any annual climatic variables, or LAI, and only water deficit duration showed a poor correlation. Annual biomass increment was well correlated to water shortage duration and was significantly influenced by drought in the previous year. â€¢ The relationship between annual NEE and biomass increment (BI) was poor: in some years, the annual carbon uptake was much higher and in others much lower than tree growth. However this relationship was much stronger and linear (r 2 = 0.93) on a weekly to monthly time-scale from budburst to the date of radial growth cessation, indicating a strong link between net carbon uptake and tree growth, while carbon losses by respiration occurring after this date upset this relationship. â€¢ Despite the lack of correlation between annual data, the NEE and BI cumulated over the 10 years of observations were very close. â€¢ On the annual time-scale, net primary productivity calculated from eddy fluxes and from biological measurements showed a good correlation.

Such measurements are also needed to parameterize and test biogeochemical, ecological and hydrological assessment models. Responding to this need, eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and water vapour were made ever a deciduous forest growing near Oak Ridge, TN, between April 1993 and April 1994. Periodic measurements were made of leaf area index, stomatal resistance, soil moisture and pre-dawn leaf water potential to characterize the gas exchange capacity of the canopy. Four factors had a disproportionate influence on the seasonal variation of CO2 flux densities. These factors were photon flux densities (during the growing season), temperature (during the dormant season), leaf area index and the occurrence of drought The drought period occurred during the peak of the growing season and caused a significant decline in daily and hourly CO2 flux densities, relative to observations over the stand when soil moisture was plentiful. The annual net uptake of carbon was calculated by integrating flux measurements and filling missing and spurious data with the relations obtained between measured CO2 fluxes and environmental forcing variables. The net flux of carbon for the period between April 1993 and April 1994 was -525 g C m-2 y-1. This value represents a net flux of carbon from the atmosphere and into the forest. The net annual carbon exchange of this southern temperate broadleaved forest exceeded values measured over a northern temperate forest (which experiences a shorter growing season and has less leaf area) by 200 g C m-2 y-1 (cf. Wofsy et al 1993). The seasonal variation of canopy evaporation (latent heat flux) was controlled mostly by changes in leaf area and net radiation. A strong depression in evaporation rates was not observed during the drought Over a broadleaved forest large vapour pressure deficits promote evaporation and trees in a mixed stand are able to tap a variety of deep and shallow water sources.

Climatic conditions were slightly warmer than normal with precipitation exceeding evapotranspiration at each site. Annual ecosystem respiration (R) derived from daytime analyses of EC data was 1141, 815 and 521Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year and was consistently lower than nighttime EC estimates of 1193, 897 and 578Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year for SOA, SOBS and SOJP, respectively. The differences, however, were not statistically significant given the large uncertainty associated with each analytical technique. The uncertainty in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was assessed by randomly simulating missing data and gap filling using simple biophysical algorithms. The uncertainty analysis supports the finding that each site was a net sink, and that differences in NEP were only significant between SOA and SOBS. The annual NEP and uncertainty for SOA, SOBS and SOJP was 122 (64-142), 35 (18-53) and 78 (61-91)Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year, respectively. These relatively old growth forests represent a weak to moderate carbon sink. Despite having the shortest growing period, carbon sequestration was greatest at SOA because of its relatively large photosynthetic capacity (Amax). At the evergreen sites, Amax was marginally larger at SOBS; however, annual carbon sequestration was smaller as a result of greater R. The evergreen sites exhibited a pronounced mid-season reduction in NEP, which was attributed to a large increase in R while Amax had not reached its full capacity. Non-growing season R resulted in a carbon loss of 285, 120 and 64Â gÂ CÂ m-2 and accounted for 70, 80 and 46% of the summertime NEP at SOA, SOBS and SOJP, respectively. Six years of EC data at SOA indicate that carbon sequestration at boreal aspen sites may benefit from warmer climatic conditions because R is relatively conservative and photosynthesis increases in response to a longer growing period.",

Climatic conditions were significantly warmer and drier than the 30-year climate normal, resulting in lower RE and an unprecedented increase in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In the 7-year record (1994, and 1996-2001) of CO2 exchange at SOA, the year 2001 showed the greatest carbon gain (300Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year). Scaled chamber measurements (1315Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) were 37% larger than the EC estimate of RE (961Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year). The difference between the scaled chambers and the EC estimate was reduced to 20% after correcting for lack of energy balance closure. Annual RE was approximately 170Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year lower than the average of the previous 6 years. Annual estimates of microbial-heterotrophic (Rh) (510Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) and autotrophic respiration (Ra) (805Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year), based on chamber measurements, were used to help validate the EC estimate of RE. Ra represented 61% of the total chamber respiration. This fraction was used to partition RE into Ra and Rh to calculate net primary production (NPP). The values of NEP (300Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) and NPP (675Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) were more characteristic of temperate forests. The NPP/Pg ratio of 0.54 was within the range of recently published values using biometric techniques and supports that the annual ecosystem respiration budget and its partitioning was well constrained. We recognize, however, that this ratio will vary interannually depending on climatic conditions. In 7 years of annual EC CO2 flux measurements at SOA, this study provides the first evidence that drought can lead to a transient increase in CO2 sequestration resulting from a reduction of RE.",

Based on a modified forest growth and yield model (STEMS), aboveground living biomass of the tree stratum on the perched bogs was declining by about 0.5 t ha-1 year-1 from a base of 100.7 t ha-1, and on the raised bogs it was increasing by 0.2 t ha-1 year-1 on a base of 31.0 t ha-1. Net primary productivity of that stratum was 3.1 and l.0 t ha-1 year-1 on the perched and raised bogs, respectively. Low shrub aboveground productivity, equal to mortality, was 0.4 and 2.0 t ha-1 year-1 on the perched and raised bogs, respectively. This was about 40% of the standing biomass of shrubs in both bog types. Aboveground net primary productivity of woody strata was 3.5 and 3.0 t ha-1 year-1 on the perched and raised bogs, respectively. These data are comparable to earlier estimates of Sphagnum production on the same bogs: 3.8 t ha-1 year-1 on perched bogs and 3.2 t ha-1 year-1 on raised bogs. Vascular herbs contributed an additional 0.2 t ha-1 year-1 to aboveground production on the perched bogs and 0.1 t ha-1 year-1 on the raised bogs. The higher productivity of perched bogs is probably related to slightly higher nutrient status related to their landscape position. The total productivity of all strata of these ombrotrophic sites approaches that of upland sites in the same region.",

In general, the observed annual carbon net ecosystem exchange (NEE) indicates a high net sink from .395 g C m-2 a-1 (2003) to .698 g C m-2 a-1 (1999) with a coefficient of variation cv = 16.6%. The yearly evapotranspiration (ET) has a lower interannual variability (cv = 9.5%) between 389 mm (2003) and 537 mm (2000). The influence of flux correction and gap filling on the amount of annual NEE and ET is considerable. Using different methods of gap filling (non-linear regressions, mean diurnal courses) yields annual NEE totals that differ by up to 18%.Consistency analysis regarding energy balance closure, comparisons with independent soil respiration and biomass increment measurements indicate reliability of the fluxes. The average gap of the energy balance is 15% of the available energy based on regression slope with an intercept of 3 to 16 W m-2, but around zero for annual flux ratios. Between 47% and 63% of the net ecosystem productivity was fixed above ground according to up-scaled tree ring data and forest inventories, respectively.

This should allow the extension of afforestation activities into drier regions. Using eddy flux, physiological and inventory measurements we provide the first quantitative information on such potential from a 35-year old afforestation system of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) at the edge of the Negev desert. This 2800 ha arid-land forest contains 6.5 Â± 1.2 kg C m-2, and continues to accumulate 0.13-0.24 kg C m-2 yr-1. The CO2 uptake is highest during the winter, out of phase with most northern hemispheric forest activity. This seasonal offset offers low latitude forests ~10 ppm higher CO2 concentrations than that available to higher latitude forests during the productive season, in addition to the 30% increase in mean atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the 1850s. Expanding afforestation efforts into drier regions may be significant for C sequestration and associated benefits (restoration of degraded land, reducing runoff, erosion and soil compaction, improving wildlife) because of the large spatial scale of the regions potentially involved (ca. 2 x 109 ha of global shrub-land and C4 grassland). Quantitative information on forest activities under dry conditions may also become relevant to regions predicted to undergo increasing aridity. ",

Instead, we provide quantitative information from a 6-year study in a 40-year old pine forest at the dry â€œtimberlineâ€ (280 mm annual rainfall) on soil CO2 efflux (Fs) and some of its controlling factors. Annual Fs was relatively low (405.9 Â± 23.8 g C m-2 a-1), but within one standard deviation of a global nonlinear relationship we derived between mean annual precipitation and Fs in forests. Seasonal variations in Fs were dominated by soil temperature (with Q10 = 2.45) in the wet season, and by soil moisture in the water-limited seasons, but not by pulse responses to precipitation. No temperature sensitivity was observed in the dry season, but there was clear evidence for down regulation of sensitivity to Q10 = 1.18 when soil moisture was kept high by a supplement summer irrigation treatment. Interannual variations in Fs correlated linearly with cumulative rainwater availability, indicating the combined importance of both precipitation amount and its temporal distribution between the wet (and cool) season and the transitional periods characterized by high evaporative demand. Low rates of soil carbon loss combined with high belowground carbon allocation (41% of canopy CO2 uptake) might explain the high soil organic carbon accumulation and net ecosystem productivity in this dry forest. Our results indicate that Fs in pine forests may adjust to dry conditions with better carbon economy than estimated from response to episodic drought in more temperate climate. ",

Here we investigated impacts of logging in uplands and agricultural deforestation in lowlands on C and nitrogen (N) stocks in Interior Alaska, using chronosequences, and synthesized results from other studies in the boreal region. Two years after logging, ecosystem C stocks in upland forests were reduced by 11Â kgÂ m-2 (46% of the original ecosystem C stock), mainly as a consequence of stem removal. Soil C and N stocks increased over the first few years after logging, but returned to pre-harvest levels during the following decades to century. Studies across the boreal region showed that mean initial C loss was four times greater, but long-term C cycling was similar in logged as compared to burned forests. Agricultural development in Alaskan lowlands permanently reduced ecosystem C stocks, reaching losses of 11Â kgÂ m-2 (34% of the ecosystem C stock) on non-permafrost soils after several decades and 31Â kgÂ m-2 (69%) on permafrost soils over 6Â years. These C losses are much more rapid than the 5-6Â kgÂ m-2 over 500Â years that models project to be lost by warming or warming-plus-wildfire in lowland boreal forests. If economic incentives and climate warming augment boreal land-use change in lowlands because of improved agricultural opportunities and performance, this could magnify warming-induced C loss and amplify climate warming. These impacts can be reduced by conserving permafrost-dominated sites for C storage and focusing agriculture on permafrost-free sites.",

The stand is a natural grown, unmanaged mixture of deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest and the trees cover a wide range of age classes with a maximum about 450 years. The objective of this study was to test the traditional hypothesis that forests at a late stage of development are insignificant carbon sinks. CO2 exchanges of the ecosystem were studied under conditions of adequate soil water supply. The main results are that:(1)Ecosystem respiration and its components, including soil, stem and leaf respiration, all fit exponential correlations with soil or air temperature, but the ratios of these components to total ecosystem respiration varied during the year. When temperature rose, the ratio of soil respiration to total respiration was relatively stable, while that of leaf and stem respiration increased and decreased, respectively. Soil respiration was the biggest component (48% of the whole ecosystem respiration on average, without including the respiration of fallen trees and coarse woody debris). Leaf respiration was the second largest (22-40%) and stem respiration was the least (13-29%).(2)The ecosystem has very large assimilation potential as environmental factors are adequate in growing season, but the actual gross ecosystem exchange (Gee) was only about 45% of the potential due to the influence of water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). High VPD reduced the photosynthetic capacity and the highest relative reductions occurred in afternoon when VPD was higher, with relative reductions between 0.3 and 0.6 during this time. Bigger reduction occurred in May and July, corresponding the 2 months when VPD are higher.(3)Respiration (Re) and net ecosystem exchange (Nee) were about 74% and 26% of actual Gee during growing season. Net assimilation began in the middle of April and ended in early September. The largest uptake occurred in June, then July and August. Large net CO2 losses occurred in late September and October because of relatively high temperature and leaf fall from most trees in the forest.(4)This forest was a carbon sink of 169-187Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1 over a 12-month-period commencing August 2002. Application of the u* correction decreased the annual uptake of carbon by 24.6Â gÂ CÂ m-2 on average, corresponding to 13.5% of the corrected annual Nee.There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of long-term net carbon exchange even in sites with ideal topography using Eddy-covariance.

However, our understanding of ecosystem respiration is rather limited compared with photosynthesis or gross primary productivity, particularly in Mediterranean montane ecosystems. In order to investigate how environmental variables and forest structure (tree classes) affect different respiration components and RECO in a Mediterranean beech forest, we measured soil, stem and leaf CO2 efflux rates with dynamic chambers and RECO by the eddy-covariance technique over 1 year (2007-2008). Ecosystem respiration showed marked seasonal variation, with the highest rates in spring and autumn and the lowest in summer. We found that the soil respiration (SR) was mainly controlled by soil water content below a threshold value of 0.2 m3 m-3, above which the soil temperature explained temporal variation in SR. Stem CO2 effluxes were influenced by air temperature and difference between tree classes with higher rates measured in dominant trees than in co-dominant ones. Leaf respiration (LR) varied significantly between the two canopy layers considered. Non-structural carbohydrates were a very good predictor of LR variability. We used these measurements to scale up respiration components to ecosystem respiration for the whole canopy and obtained cumulative amounts of carbon losses over the year. Based on the up-scaled chamber measurements, the relative contributions of soil, stem and leaves to the total annual CO2 efflux were: 56, 8 and 36%, respectively. These results confirm that SR is the main contributor of ecosystem respiration and provided an insight on the driving factors of respiration in Mediterranean montane beech forests.",

Tree density and stand basal area ranged, respectively, from 368 to 1700Â ha-1 and 15.5 to 25.3Â m2Â ha-1 in non-flooded and from 725 to 2005Â ha-1 and 22.1 to 32.6Â m2Â ha-1 in seasonally flooded forests. There were no significant differences in stem density and basal area between non-flooded and seasonally flooded forest. Species richness ranged from 4 to 17 per plot. Small litterfall (leaves, wood=2Â cm, reproductive parts, trash<2Â mm) was collected monthly over three years in 25 litter traps on each plot. Dry weights and element concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al) of litter fractions were determined. Concentrations of P, Ca, and Mg were highest in leaf litter from plots with many deciduous species. Accumulated Al (1.4%) was found in litter from Vochysia divergens Pohl. Element accession rates were low in deciduous and high in semi-deciduous and evergreen forest. Total litterfall in non-flooded deciduous and semi-deciduous forest (4.86 to 7.71Â tÂ ha-1Â year-1) was significantly lower than in seasonally flooded evergreen forest (7.53 to 10.27Â tÂ ha-1Â year-1). The findings show that, despite seasonal water excess being the prominent feature of the Pantanal, it is water shortage in the dry season that limits forest productivity.",

Measurements were made in 68% of the hours during the year of study, with > 50% coverage in all months except December and August. Data were filtered by wind direction and atmospheric turbulence to remove invalid measurements. Analysis of filtered data showed that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was significant in predicting C exchange, except during the winter. Daily minimum air temperature affected C exchange in autumn and winter, whereas time of day, water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature had significant effects on C storage in spring, summer and fall. Most C storage in the stand occurred in April through July and in October 2001, with maximum rates in April and May. Persistent cold weather prevented C storage in December through March. In early spring 2001, C uptake was sensitive to nocturnal frost: daily minimum air temperatures below 0 Â°C reduced C fixation, and minima below -5 Â°C caused its virtual cessation. Soil temperature was a poor predictor of C balance during this period. In August, high soil and air temperatures (averaging 16.7 and 21.1 Â°C, respectively) drove high ecosystem respiration, which approximately balanced C uptake. These patterns show potential for stimulated C storage in hemlock forests in a warmer climate with fewer spring and autumn frosts, but reduced C storage during warmer summers. Estimated annual C storage was 3.0 Mg ha-1, which is higher than for younger coniferous and deciduous forests during earlier years in the northeastern USA. Long-term data are needed to determine if the estimated high C storage in this hemlock forest is a result of interannual climate variation or an effect of forest composition.",

At the alpine treeline, we experimentally warmed undisturbed soils by 4Â K for one growing season with heating cables at the soil surface and measured the response of net C uptake by plants, of soil respiration, and of leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Soil warming increased soil CO2 effluxes instantaneously and throughout the whole vegetation period (+45%; +120Â gÂ CÂ mÂ y-1). In contrast, DOC leaching showed a negligible response of a 5% increase (NS). Annual C uptake of new shoots was not significantly affected by elevated soil temperatures, with a 17, 12, and 14% increase for larch, pine, and dwarf shrubs, respectively, resulting in an overall increase in net C uptake by plants of 20-40Â gÂ CÂ m-2y-1. The Q 10 of 3.0 measured for soil respiration did not change compared to a 3-year period before the warming treatment started, suggesting little impact of warming-induced lower soil moisture (-15% relative decrease) or increased soil C losses. The fraction of recent plant-derived C in soil respired CO2 from warmed soils was smaller than that from control soils (25 vs. 40% of total C respired), which implies that the warming-induced increase in soil CO2 efflux resulted mainly from mineralization of older SOM rather than from stimulated root respiration. In summary, one season of 4Â K soil warming, representative of hot years, led to C losses from the studied alpine treeline ecosystem by increasing SOM decomposition more than C gains through plant growth.",

Here, we assessed the effects of nine years of CO2 enrichment on soil microbial communities of an alpine treeline ecosystem with 35-year-old Larix decidua and Pinus mugo ssp. uncinata trees. We also tracked the 13C signal of supplemental CO2 in soil-respired CO2, microbial biomass, and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in undisturbed mor-type organic layers. We found a persistently increased soil CO2 efflux (+24% on average), but negligible effects of elevated CO2 on the biomass and community structure of soil microorganisms under both tree species determined with PLFA and T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). The 13C tracing over 9 years revealed that 24-40% of the soil microbial biomass was composed of â€˜new' plant-derived C. PLFA from gram-negative biomarkers did not significant shift in 13C by the CO2 addition, while those of gram-negative bacteria were significantly altered. The highest 13C signals in individual PLFA was found in the fatty acid 18:2<U+03C9>6,9 with 65-80% new C, indicating that new plant-derived C was primarily incorporated by soil fungi. However, CO2 enrichment did not affect the production of mycelia biomass and the structure and composition of the fungal communities analysed by high-throughput 454-sequencing of genetic markers. Collectively, our results suggest that C flux through the plant-soil system will be accelerated but that the biomass and composition of microbial communities will be little affected by rising atmospheric CO2 in organic matter rich treeline soils.",

The partitioning of these fluxes is of utmost importance to evaluate implications of environmental change on soil carbon cycling and sequestration. At three girdled forest stands in Sweden and Germany, where the tree root (autotrophic) respiration had been eliminated, we measured both flux rates and 14C contents of soil respired CO2 in girdled and control plots in the summers of 2001 or 2002. At all stands, CO2 flux rates were slightly higher in the control plots, whereas the 14C contents of respired CO2 tended to be higher in the girdled plots. This was expected and confirmed that heterotrophically respired CO2 cycles more slowly through the forest ecosystem than autotrophically respired CO2. On the basis of these data, the contributions of hetero- and autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration were calculated using two separate approaches (i.e. based on flux rates or 14C). Fractions of heterotrophic respiration ranged from 53% to 87%. Values calculated by both approaches did not differ significantly from each other. Finally, we compared the 14C contents of soil respired CO2 in the girdled plots with the 14C contents of heterotrophically respired CO2 calculated by three different 14C models. None of the models matched the measured data sufficiently. In addition, we suspect that inherent effects of girdling may cause the 14C content of CO2 respired in the girdled plots to be lower than â€˜true' heterotrophically respired CO2 in an undisturbed plot. Nevertheless, we argue that measurements and modeling of 14C can be developed into a valuable tool for separating heterotrophic and autotrophic soil respiration (e.g. when girdling cannot be performed).

After 4Â years, basal area of pine trees was 9.2% larger in elevated than in ambient CO2 plots. During the first 3Â years the growth rate of pine was stimulated by ~26%. In the fourth year this stimulation declined to 23%. The average net ecosystem production (NEP) in the ambient plots was 428Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1, indicating that the forest was a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO2 stimulated NEP by 41%. This increase was primarily an increase in plant biomass increment (57%), and secondarily increased accumulation of carbon in the forest floor (35%) and fine root increment (8%). Net primary production (NPP) was stimulated by 27%, driven primarily by increases in the growth rate of the pines. Total heterotrophic respiration (R h) increased by 165%, but total autotrophic respiration (R a) was unaffected. Gross primary production was increased by 18%. The largest uncertainties in the carbon budget remain in separating belowground heterotrophic (soil microbes) and autotrophic (root) respiration. If applied to temperate forests globally, the increase in NEP that we measured would fix less than 10% of the anthropogenic CO2 projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. This may represent an upper limit because rising global temperatures, land disturbance, and heterotrophic decomposition of woody tissues will ultimately cause an increased flux of carbon back to the atmosphere.",

The total carbon storage in aboveground biomass, litter layer and soil of the secondary forest stand was 313.12 Mg C/ha, which was 1.7 times larger than the carbon storage of the large leafed mahogany plantation (185.28 Mg C/ha). The stocks of carbon in the aboveground biomass and soil were higher in the secondary forest stand than in the large leafed mahogany plantation. The carbon content in litter layer was higher in the large leafed mahogany plantation than in the secondary forest stand. The soil carbon storage in the secondary forest stand and large leafed mahogany plantation at a depth from 0 similar to 60 cm was 82.25 and 69.04 Mg C/ha, respectively. The higher soil carbon stock in the secondary forest stand was due to the soil carbon stock in the 0 similar to 20 cm depth. The litter production in the dry season was higher in the large leafed mahogany plantation (4.23 Mg C/ha) than in the secondary forest stand (2.90 Mg C/ha) because of the high weight of the fruit. The litter production in the wet season was higher in the secondary forest stand than in the large leafed mahogany plantation because of the high mass of leaves and branches. The dry and wet season soil respiration difference between the control and trenching treatment was higher in the large leafed mahogany plantation than in the secondary forest stand The soil temperature decreased from wet season to dry season. The temperature difference between the large leafed mahogany plantation and secondary forest stand was higher in the dry season. The high carbon emission from the secondary forest stand was due to the:high soil respiration and high bacteria count. In this study, two important types of tropical vegetation, large leafed mahogany plantation and secondary forest stand, showed differences in carbon storage and seasonal, annual carbon flux patterns. The differences will feed back on the carbon and nutrient cycling in this tropical ecosystem in Mt. Makiling, Luzon, Philippines.",0

We conducted an aboveground litterfall manipulation experiment in three successional forests in the subtropics to examine the soil respiration responses to different litter inputs from January 2010 to July 2012. The soil respiration decreased by 35% in the litter exclusion treatments and increased by 77% in the doubled litter additions across all three forests. The reduction in soil respiration induced by the litter exclusion was greatest in the early successional forest, which may be related to a decrease in the soil moisture and shifts in the microbial community. The increase in soil respiration produced by the doubled litter addition was largest in the mature forest, which was most probably due to its relatively high quantity and quality of litterfall. Our results suggest that the effect of reduced litter inputs on the soil respiration lessened with forest succession but that the doubled litter inputs resulted in a stronger priming effect in the mature forest than in the other two forests.",

After 5 years of fallow, mean aerial woody biomass production rates ranged from 5.30Â tÂ ha-1 per year for Acacia and 5.73Â tÂ ha-1 per year for Eucalyptus to 3.81Â tÂ ha-1 per year for Senna; furthermore, the total dry matter (DM) accumulation (root, shoot and litter) of tree fallows represented 2.5-4 times that of the herbaceous fallows. Regarding root mass, these proportions are increased to 5-7 times for the three tree species studied. Acacia had higher N and Mg contents in total DM than the other treatments while Eucalyptus had the greatest accumulation of Ca. Acacia and Eucalyptus had similar accumulation of total DM, P and K. Senna was not so productive as the other tree species but it accumulated a large quantity of K. Over a 7-year period, Acacia, a N-fixing species, accumulated in its total DM, 340 and 412Â kgÂ NÂ ha-1 more than Eucalyptus and Senna (non-N-fixing species) did, respectively. In the context of intensive harvest of aerial biomass, the accumulation of nutrients in the belowground components is a process of high importance. The N accumulation in the Acacia root mass (342Â kgÂ ha-1) represented roughly the total N accumulation in Eucalyptus or Senna stands. In Eucalyptus the root system accounted for only 18-27% of the accumulation of total DM and nutrients, while much greater proportions were found under Senna (39-52%) and Acacia (32-47%). Thus, the harvesting methods of the aerial biomass will play an important part in the conservation of the nutrients of the system, especially in the case of Eucalyptus. Nutrient removal by harvesting under different logging scenarios was evaluated. For Eucalyptus, the technique of de-barking on-site reduced the removal of Ca and Mg by 70 and 43%, respectively. Furthermore, the results show that in the long term, in comparison to removal of timber at the end of the rotation, annual harvesting of grass for fodder in tree fallows in the Sudanian zone of Africa, would be an equally important or even a more serious risk to site fertility.",

Therefore to understand the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems, it is important to determine the dynamics of soil CO2 efflux. This study was conducted to describe temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux and identify the environmental factors that affect it. We measured soil CO2 efflux continuously in a beech secondary forest in the Appi Highlands in Iwate Prefecture for two years (except when there was snow cover) using four dynamic closed chambers that automatically open after taking measurements. Temporal changes in soil temperature and volumetric soil water content were also measured at a depth of 5 cm. The soil CO2 efflux ranged from 14 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 to 2,329 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, the peak occurring at the beginning of August. The relationship between soil temperature and soil CO2 efflux was well represented by an exponential function. Most of temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux was explained by soil temperature rather than volumetric soil water content. The Q10 values were 3.7 Â± 0.8 and estimated annual carbon emissions were 837 Â± 210 g C m-2 year-1. These results provide a foundation for further development of models for prediction of soil CO2 efflux driven by environmental factors.",

Our study aimed to (1) quantify changes in soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes with land-use change and (2) determine their controlling factors. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes on heavily weathered soils that differ mainly in texture: loam and clay Acrisol soils. In each landscape, we investigated the reference land-use types (forest and secondary forest with regenerating rubber) and the converted land-use types (rubber, 7-17 years old, and oil palm plantations, 9-16 years old). We measured soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes monthly from December 2012 to December 2013. Annual soil CO2 fluxes from the reference land-use types were correlated with soil fertility: low extractable phosphorus (P) coincided with high annual CO2 fluxes from the loam Acrisol soil that had lower fertility than the clay Acrisol soil (P < 0.05). Soil CO2 fluxes from the oil palm (107.2 to 115.7 mg C m-2 h-1) decreased compared to the other land-use types (between 178.7 and 195.9 mg C m-2 h-1; P < 0.01). Across land-use types, annual CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (C) and negatively correlated with 15N signatures, extractable P and base saturation. This suggests that the reduced soil CO2 fluxes from oil palm were the result of strongly decomposed soil organic matter and reduced soil C stocks due to reduced litter input as well as being due to a possible reduction in C allocation to roots due to improved soil fertility from liming and P fertilization in these plantations. Soil CH4 uptake in the reference land-use types was negatively correlated with net nitrogen (N) mineralization and soil mineral N, suggesting N limitation of CH4 uptake, and positively correlated with exchangeable aluminum (Al), indicating a decrease in methanotrophic activity at high Al saturation. Reduction in soil CH4 uptake in the converted land-use types (ranging from -3.0 to -14.9 Âµg C m-2 h-1) compared to the reference land-use types (ranging from -20.8 to -40.3 Âµg C m-2 h-1; P < 0.01) was due to a decrease in soil N availability in the converted land-use types. Our study shows for the first time that differences in soil fertility control the soil-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in a tropical landscape, a mechanism that we were able to detect by conducting this study on the landscape scale.

Ecological stoichiometry predicts important control of the relative abundance of the key elements carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on trophic interactions. In a nutrient-poor Amazonian lowland rain forest of French Guiana, we tested the hypothesis that decomposers exploit stoichiometrically diverse plant litter more efficiently, resulting in faster litter decomposition compared to litter with a uniform stoichiometry. 2. In a field experiment in the presence or absence of soil macrofauna, we measured litter mass loss, and N and P dynamics from all possible combinations of leaf litter from four common tree species which were distinctly separated along a C:N and along a N:P gradient. 3. Mean litter mass remaining after 204 days of field exposure varied between 25.2% and 71.3% among litter treatments. Fauna increased litter mass loss by 18%, N loss by 21% and P loss by 14%. Litter species richness had no effect on litter mass loss or nutrient dynamics. In contrast, litter mass and nutrient losses increased with increasing stoichiometric dissimilarity of litter mixtures in presence of fauna, suggesting faster decomposition of a stoichiometrically more heterogeneous litter. 4. However, the effect of stoichiometric dissimilarity was smaller than the strong C quality related litter composition effect and disappeared in the absence of fauna. Increasing proportions of litter that is relatively rich in accessible C compounds (non-structural carbohydrates, phenolics) and relatively poor in recalcitrant C (condensed tannins, lignin), correlated best with litter mass loss irrespective of fauna presence. No correlation was found for any of the nutrient related litter quality parameters and decomposition. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that Amazonian decomposer communities studied here are primarily limited by energy, and only secondarily by litter stoichiometry. Tropical tree species might thus influence decomposers and detritivores by the production of litter of specific C quality with potentially important feedback effects on ecosystem nutrient dynamics and availability.

Fine root production ranged from 150 to 284 g m-2 year-1 and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots. Coarse root production ranged from 60 to 90 g m-2 year-1 and was significantly lower for fertilized plots than for unfertilized plots.

Minor year-to-year variation in litterfall was attributed to incidence of severe storms, and drought. Lianes were responsible for about 17% of leaf litterfall in spring, 21% in the summerpeak, and 40% in autumn, more lianes than trees being deciduous. Leaf litter production by 23 individual species of liane, in relation to their basal area within the main site, was, on average, 15 times as great as that by 34 tree species, but declined more steeply between the species-groups of early and later succession. Tendrillar lianes, unlike twiners and scramblers, were confined to the â€˜early' successional group, and their foliage was spread across canopy surfaces, maximizing light interception. It was concluded that this contributed to greater production of leaf litter, per unit basal area, by tendrillar than by other climbers, and to the successional decline in leaf litterfall from lianes.",

Here, we measured litterfall for two years in ?ve lower montane 1-ha plots spanning a soil fertility and pre-cipitation gradient in lower montane forest at Fortuna, Panama. Litterfall was also measured in a concurrent nitrogen fertilization experi-ment at one site. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to test for site (or treatment), year, and season effects on vegetative,reproductive and total litterfall. We predicted that total litterfall, and the ratio of reproductive to leaf litterfall, would increase with nutri-ent availability along the fertility gradient, and in response to nitrogen addition. We found that total annual litterfall varied substantiallyamong 1-ha plots (4.78 Mg/ha/yr to 7.96 Mg/ha/yr), and all but the most aseasonal plot showed signi?cant seasonality in litterfall.However, litterfall accumulation did not track soil nutrient availability; instead forest growing on relatively infertile soil, but dominatedby an ectomycorrhizal tree species, had the highest total litterfall accumulation. In the fertilization plots, signi?cantly more total litter fellin nitrogen addition relative to control plots, but this increase in response to nitrogen (13%) was small compared to variation observedamong 1-ha plots.

We measured wood nutrient concentrations in 106 tree species in 10 forest plots spanning a regional fertility gradient in Panama. For a subset of species, we quantified foliar nutrients and wood density to test whether wood nutrients scale with foliar nutrients at the species level, or wood nutrient storage increases with wood density as predicted by the wood economics spectrum. Wood nutrient concentrations varied enormously among species from fourfold in nitrogen (N) to > 30?fold in calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P). Community?weighted mean wood nutrient concentrations correlated positively with soil Ca, K, Mg and P concentrations. Wood nutrients scaled positively with leaf nutrients, supporting the hypothesis that nutrient allocation is conserved across plant organs. Wood P was most sensitive to variation in soil nutrient availability, and significant radial declines in wood P indicated that tropical trees retranslocate P as sapwood transitions to heartwood. Wood P decreased with increasing wood density, suggesting that low wood P and dense wood are traits associated with tree species persistence on low fertility soils. Substantial variation among species and communities in wood nutrient concentrations suggests that allocation of nutrients to wood, especially P, influences species distributions and nutrient dynamics in tropical forests.",

However, the components, environmental responses and controls of the soil CO2 efflux (Rs) are still unclear and limited by field data availability. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the contribution of the various Rs components, specifically its mycorrhizal component, (2) to determine their temporal variability, and (3) to establish their environmental responses and dependence on gross primary productivity (GPP). In a temperate deciduous oak forest in south east England hourly soil and ecosystem CO2 fluxes over four years were measured using automated soil chambers and eddy covariance techniques. Mesh-bag and steel collar soil chamber treatments prevented root or both root and mycorrhizal hyphal in-growth, respectively, to allow separation of heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) soil CO2 fluxes and the Ra components, roots (Rr) and mycorrhizal hyphae (Rm). Annual cumulative Rs values were very similar between years (740 Â± 43 g C m-2 yr-1) with an average flux of 2.0 Â± 0.3 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1, but Rs components varied. On average, annual Rr, Rm and Rh fluxes contributed 38, 18 and 44%, respectively, showing a large Ra contribution (56%) with a considerable Rm component varying seasonally. Soil temperature largely explained the daily variation of Rs (R2 = 0.81), mostly because of strong responses by Rh (R2 = 0.65) and less so for Rr (R2 = 0.41) and Rm (R2 = 0.18). Time series analysis revealed strong daily periodicities for Rs and Rr, whilst Rm was dominated by seasonal (~150 days), and Rh by annual periodicities. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed that Rr and Rm were related to short-term (daily) GPP changes, but for Rm there was a strong relationship with GPP over much longer (weekly to monthly) periods and notably during periods of low Rr. The need to include individual Rs components in C flux models is discussed, in particular, the need to represent the linkage between GPP and Ra components, in addition to temperature responses for each component. The potential consequences of these findings for understanding the limitations for long-term forest C sequestration are highlighted, as GPP via root-derived C including Rm seems to function as a C ""overflow tap"", with implications on the turnover of SOC.

Although the range of N and P availability across sites was broad, there was little difference in NPP between sites, and in contrast to theories of carbon allocation relative to limiting resources, we found no consistent relationships in production allocation to leaves, fine roots or wood. However, canopy nutrient pools and fluxes were correlated with the mass of fine roots per unit soil volume and there was a weak but positive correlation of NPP with LAI. Patterns of e and NUE across the soil developmental sequence were opposite to each other. e increased as nutrient availability and nutrient turnover increased, while NUE decreased in response to the same influences but reached its highest values where either N or P availability and turnover of both N and P were low. A negative correlation between e and NUE supports the hypothesis that a trade-off exists between e and leaf characteristics affecting NUE.",

Re was estimated at 10.32 Mg C ha-1 year-1; heterotrophic respiration (Rh) accounted for 52% of Re and autotrophic respiration (Ra) accounted for the remainder. We estimated NPP at 3.02 Mg C ha-1 year-1, including production of bryophyte biomass but not including shrub NPP. We used these estimates of carbon fluxes to calculate a carbon use efficiency [CUE = NPP/(NPP + Ra)] of 0.38. This estimate of CUE is similar to those reported for other boreal forest ecosystems and it is lower than the value frequently used in global studies. Based on the estimate of Rh being greater than the estimate of NPP, the ecosystem was determined to emit approximately 2.38 Mg C ha-1 year-1 to the atmosphere in 2005. Estimates of gross primary production (GPP = NPP + Ra) and Re differed substantially from estimates of these fluxes derived from eddy covariance measurements during 2005 at this site. The ecological estimates of GPP and Re were substantially greater than those estimated for eddy covariance measurements. Applying a correction for lack of energy balance closure to eddy covariance estimates reduces differences with ecological estimates. We reviewed possible sources of systematic error in ecological estimates and discuss other possible explanations for these discrepancies.",

Fine root production, fine root turnover, and the associated carbon fluxes from the fine root system to the soil were estimated with three different approaches in five stands ranging from an old growth forest with negligible anthropogenic disturbance to a cacao agroforestry system with planted shade trees. Annual fine root production and mortality in three natural forest sites with increasing canopy openness decreased continuously with increasing forest disturbance, with a reduction of more than 45% between the undisturbed forest and the forest with large timber extraction. Cacao agroforestry stands had higher fine root production and mortality rates than forest with large timber extraction but less than undisturbed forest. The amount of carbon annually transferred to the soil carbon pool through fine root mortality was highest in the undisturbed forest and generally decreased with increasing forest use intensity. However, root-related C flux was also relatively high in the plantation with planted shading trees. In contrast, the relative importance of C transfer from root death in the total above- and below-ground C input to the soil increased with increasing forest use intensity and was even similar to the C input via leaf litter fall in the more intensively managed agroforest. We conclude that moderate to heavy disturbance in South-east Asian tropical moist forests has a profound impact on fine root turnover and the related carbon transfer to the soil.",

For this analysis, soil respiration (Rs) data were assembled from 31 AmeriFlux and CarboEurope sites representing deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf, grasslands, mixed deciduous/evergreen and woodland/savanna ecosystem types. Lowest to highest rates of soil respiration averaged over the growing season were grassland and woodland/savanna < deciduous broadleaf forests < evergreen needleleaf, mixed deciduous/evergreen forests with growing season soil respiration significantly different between forested and non-forested biomes (pÂ <Â 0.001). Timing of peak respiration rates during the growing season varied from March/April in grasslands to July-September for all other biomes. Biomes with overall strongest relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature were from the deciduous and mixed forests (R2Â =Â 0.65). Maximum soil respiration was weakly related to maximum fine root biomass (R2Â =Â 0.28) and positively related to the previous years' annual litterfall (R2Â =Â 0.46). Published rates of annual soil respiration were linearly related to LAI and fine root carbon (R2Â =Â 0.48, 0.47), as well as net primary production (NPP) (R2Â =Â 0.44). At 10 sites, maximum growing season Rs was weakly correlated with annual GPP estimated from eddy covariance towersites (R2Â =Â 0.29; pÂ <Â 0.05), and annual soil respiration and total growing season Rs were not correlated with annual GPP (pÂ >Â 0.1). Yet, previous studies indicate correlations on shorter time scales within site (e.g., weekly, monthly). Estimates of annual GPP from the Biome-BGC model were strongly correlated with observed annual estimates of soil respiration for six sites (R2Â =Â 0.84; pÂ <Â 0.01). Correlations from observations of Rs with NPP, LAI, fine root biomass and litterfall relate above and belowground inputs to labile pools that are available for decomposition. Our results suggest that simple empirical relationships with temperature and/or moisture that may be robust at individual sites may not be adequate to characterize soil CO2 effluxes across space and time, agreeing with other multi-site studies. Information is needed on the timing and phenological controls of substrate availability (e.g., fine roots, LAI) and inputs (e.g., root turnover, litterfall) to improve our ability to accurately quantify the relationships between soil CO2 effluxes and carbon substrate storage.",

However, a knowledge of the CO2 balance of larch forests based on long-term flux measurements is very restricted in East Asia. Thus, a long-term flux measurement has been started in 2000 at a larch plantation on a flat terrain in Hokkaido, Japan to obtain more information on the CO2 and energy balances of larch forests. From September 2000 to August 2001 the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) changed seasonally in accordance with the annual cycles of phenology and climate. NEE was negative for six months of the growing season, May-September; the larch ecosystem was a carbon sink with a peak intensity of -0.38 mol m-2 d-1 for this period. In the leafless season from November to April the forest ecosystem was a carbon source with an intensity ranging between 0 and 0.05 mol m-2 d-1. Annual NEE from September 2000 to August 2001 was -24.4 to -32.4 mol m-2 yr-1 (=-293 to -389 gC m-2 yr-1); this value is compatible with those reported from other temperate forests.

We evaluated soil CO2 efflux or total soil respiration, topsoil (the A-horizon) respiration, and subsoil (the C-horizon) respiration using a modified flux gradient method. Thereby, we investigated seasonal and diurnal variations in these soil respirations under snowpack. Soil CO2 concentration and soil respiration changed dynamically under the condition of constant soil temperature. Topsoil respiration decreased rapidly in late autumn and relatively constant until mid-winter, whereas it increased in late winter when snowmelt progressed. On the other hand, subsoil respiration decreased gradually until mid-winter and increased slightly in late winter. Both topsoil and subsoil respirations showed similar diurnal variations with a peak in early or mid-afternoon, respectively, independently of soil temperature. These seasonal and diurnal variations in soil respiration were inferred to result from the supply of labile carbon compounds, which were respiratory substrates for microorganisms, into soil from litter with meltwater. The seasonal sum of topsoil, subsoil, and total respirations for the snow cover period of 4 months were 21.4, 48.0, and 69.4 gC m-2, respectively; these accounted for 3.0, 27.3, and 7.7% of the annual sum, respectively. The ratio of topsoil respiration to total soil respiration was 0.31 on average during the snow period, which was considerably lower than that in the summer season. ",

Since the 1970s, however, deforestation and drainage have progressed on an enormous scale. In addition, El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought and large-scale fires, which grow larger under the drought condition, are accelerating peatland devastation. That devastation enhances decomposition of soil organic matter and increases the carbon release to the atmosphere as CO2. This phenomenon suggests that tropical peatlands have already become a large CO2 source, but related quantitative information is limited. Therefore, we evaluated the CO2 balance of a tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, using 3 years of CO2 fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique from 2002 through 2004. The forest was disturbed by drainage; consequently, groundwater level (GL) was reduced. The net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) measurements showed seasonal variation, which was slightly positive or almost zero in the early dry season, and most-negative late in the dry season or early the rainy season. This seasonality is attributable to the seasonal pattern of climate, tree phenology and fires. Slightly positive NEP resulted from smaller ecosystem respiration (RE) and larger gross primary production (GPP) under conditions of high photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and large leaf area index (LAI). The most-negative NEP resulted from smaller GPP and larger RE. The smaller GPP was related to high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), small LAI and low PPFD because of smoke from fires. The larger RE was related to low GL. Annual NEP values were estimated respectively as -602, -382 and -313 g C m-2 yr-1 for 2002, 2003 and 2004. These negative NEP values show that the tropical peat swamp forest, disturbed by drainage, functioned as a CO2 source. That source intensity was highest in 2002, an ENSO year, mainly because of low PPFD caused by dense smoke emitted from large fires. ",

Soil greenhouse gas fluxes depended on land-use, water level (WL), microtopography, temperature and vegetation physiology, among which WL was the strongest driver. All sites were CH4 sources on an annual basis and the emissions were higher in sites providing fresh litter deposition and water logged conditions. Soil CO2 flux increased exponentially with soil temperature (T s) even within an amplitude of 4-5Â°C. In the NDF soil CO2 flux sharply decreased when WLs rose above -0.2 and 0.1Â m for hollows and hummocks, respectively. The sharp decrease suggests that the contribution of surface soil respiration (RS) to total soil CO2 flux is large. In the DF soil CO2 flux increased as WL decreased below -0.7Â m probably because the fast aerobic decomposition continued in lower peat. Such an increase in CO2 flux at low WLs was also found at the stand level of the DF. Soil CO2 flux showed diurnal variation with a peak in the daytime, which would be caused by the circadian rhythm of root respiration. Among the land-use types, annual soil CO2 flux was the largest in the DRF and the smallest in the AL. Overall, the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2 emissions in these land-use types was much larger than that of CH4 fluxes.",

The study evaluates interannual variations in the seasonal patterns of NEE, the annual NEE, clarifying the factors controlling the carbon balance. NEE for both open- and closed-path systems look equivalent from the half-hourly mean values; however, there is a small systematic bias in the annual cumulative totals. In this study, we used closed-path data because open-path data during winter are doubtful and the annual NEE from closed-path data was closer to the biometric NEP than that from open-path data.The 3-year averages of annual NEE, gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (RE) were -212Â Â±Â 43 (standard deviation), -1673Â Â±Â 59, and 1462Â Â±Â 42Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1, respectively. The larch plantation forest absorbed large amounts of CO2 during just 1 month, June. During that period, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was large while the temperature was not high. These meteorological conditions were suitable for CO2 absorption before the leaf area index (LAI) reached its peak. Maximum GPP at light saturation (Pmax) was also large. During the 3-year measurement period, PPFD in summer, and temperatures in spring and summer engendered remarkable interannual differences of GPP, RE, and NEE. In spring, snowmelt and larch foliation occurred about 2 weeks earlier in 2002 than in either 2001 or 2003 because of higher temperatures; consequently, the ecosystem began to photosynthesize earlier. In July, NEE was more negative in 2003 than in other years. The GPP became larger because of higher PPFD, larger Pmax; while the RE became smaller because of lower temperatures.Compared with similar forests, the amounts of GPP and RE measured here were large, but NEE was similar. The reason is that the photosynthetic capacity of larch is naturally large: the ample PPFD, and the lack of environmental stresses from dry air or soil, consequently allows high photosynthesis rates to be maintained. Moreover, it can be inferred that RE values are enhanced by the high photosynthetic activity of larch forest during the growing season.",

Study sites were widely distributed and included diverse ecosystems, such as evergreen and deciduous, coniferous and broadleaf, planted and natural forests, from subarctic to tropical zones. We measured NEP using the eddy covariance technique at 13 forest sites in East Asia.Annual values of GPP and RE are simply regulated by annual mean air temperature across East Asia. There is a clear linear relationship between annual GPP and annual mean air temperature because the air temperature influences both growing period length and the seasonal variation of the maximum photosynthetic capacity, which, together, regulate the annual GPP. On the other hand, there is a strong exponential relationship between annual RE and annual mean air temperature on an East Asia scale, which is quite similar to the relation obtained on a canopy scale. The dependency of annual RE on air temperature on the East Asia scale was similar to that of monthly RE on air temperature on an individual site scale excepting for temperate larch and mixed forests in northern Japan.The reason why the relation is simple is that severe stress, which affects GPP or RE, is small in East Asia. The present study suggests that RE is sensitive to non-climate environmental factors when compared to GPP, thus the annual RE-air temperature relationship is more scattered than the annual GPP-air temperature relationship. The NEP is small at high latitude, relatively large at mid-latitude, and scattered at low latitude. As a whole, the NEP is more influenced by RE than GPP in East Asia. Compared to North America and Europe, the increase in the ratio of GPP to air temperature is slightly higher in East Asia. One of the possible reasons for this is that GPP in East Asia is not exposed to severe environmental stresses, such as summer drought.",

This is the first study to use a completely automated soil gas sampling system in the field to measure the soil CO2 profile and collect samples of soil air for subsequent isotopic analysis. During the summer of 1999, deep soil respiration varied linearly with 50 cm temperature, with a slope of 0.2 kg C ha-1 d-1 Â°C-1. Late in the season, this respiration was dominated by decomposition of old soil organic matter (fixed from the atmosphere centuries ago). This study has taken an important step toward clarifying the temperature sensitivity of deep soil CO2 production in black spruce ecosystems through direct measurements within the soil and to quantify the seasonal variation of the relative contributions of recently fixed versus old carbon in deep soil respiration.

Tree-girdling involves stripping the stem bark to the depth of the current xylem at breast height terminating the supply of current photosynthates to roots and their mycorrhizal fungi without physically disturbing the delicate root-microbe-soil system. Here we report that girdling reduced soil respiration within 1-2 months by about 54% relative to respiration on ungirdled control plots, and that decreases of up to 37% were detected within 5 days. These values clearly show that the flux of current assimilates to roots is a key driver of soil respiration; they are conservative estimates of root respiration, however, because girdling increased the use of starch reserves in the roots. Our results indicate that models of soil respiration should incorporate measures of photosynthesis and of seasonal patterns of photosynthate allocation to roots.",

The contribution of the root respiration to the total soil respiration was higher in the soil under the beech canopy (59%) compared with the soil in the gap (29%).

Summer, mid-day carbon dioxide uptake was higher than at other boreal coniferous forests, averaging about - 13 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Nocturnal summer ecosystem respiration averaged Ëœ 6 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 at a mean temperature of Ëœ 15 Â°C. Significant ecosystem C uptake began with the thawing of the soil in early April and was abruptly reduced by the first autumn frost in early October. Half-hourly forest CO2 exchange was regulated mostly by the incident photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). In addition to the threshold effects of freezing temperatures, there were seasonal effects on the inferred photosynthetic parameters of the forest canopy. The functional response of this forest to environmental variation was similar to that of other spruce forests. In contrast to reports of carbon loss from northerly boreal forest sites, in 1996 the Howland forest was a strong carbon sink, storing about 2.1 t C ha-1. ",

An analysis of monthly flux anomalies showed that above-average spring and fall temperatures were significantly correlated with greater monthly C uptake while above-average summer temperatures were correlated with decreased net C uptake. Summer months with significantly drier or wetter soils than normal were also characterized by lower rates of C uptake. Years with above-average C storage were thus typically characterized by warmer than average spring and fall temperatures and adequate summer soil moisture. Environmental and forest-atmosphere flux data recorded from a second tower surrounded by similar forest, but sufficiently distant that flux source regions (â€˜footprints'), did not overlap significantly showed almost identical temperature and solar radiation conditions, but some differences in energy partitioning could be seen. Half-hourly as well as integrated (annual) C exchange values recorded at the separate towers were very similar, with average annual net C uptake differing between the two towers by <6%. Interannual variability in net C exchange was found to be much greater than between tower variability. Simultaneous measurements from two towers were used to estimate flux data uncertainty from a single tower. Carbon-flux model parameters derived independently from each flux tower data set were not significantly different, demonstrating that flux towers can provide a robust method for establishing C exchange model parameters.

However, questions remain concerning the rate, distribution, and duration of this potential sink. We used a chronosequence approach to determine changes in ecosystem C and N during the first 115 years of forest development after agricultural abandonment in Rhode Island, USA. All sites had similar soils, climate, land-use history, and dominant overstory vegetation (Pinus strobus), but differed in time since agricultural abandonment. Total ecosystem C increased linearly across the chronosequence at a mean rate of 2.10 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1. Most of the C was sequestered into plant biomass (73%) with less stored in the forest floor (17%) and deep mineral soil (6%; 20-70 cm depth). Total ecosystem N did not change over time; instead N accumulated in the forest floor (11.6 kg NÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1) and plant biomass (4.1 kg NÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1), and these increases were roughly balanced by a significant decrease in N content of the mineral soil (-12.4 kg NÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1). Over 90% of the storage of C and N in plant biomass occurred in the bole wood (C:N 350). Since nearly two-thirds of the forests in Rhode Island have established since 1900, net ecosystem C storage will likely continue for the next century if these forests remain undisturbed. Our results show that wood biomass is an important sink for both C and N in regrowing forests for at least one century after agricultural abandonment. Corresponding Editor: A. D. McGuire. ",

The fate of this extra carbon on the forest floor or in mineral soil is currently not clear. Moreover, increased rates of NPP can be maintained only if forests can escape nitrogen limitation. In a Free atmospheric CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment near Bangor, Wales, 4 ambient and 4 elevated [CO2] plots were planted with patches of Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Fagus sylvatica on a former arable field. After 4 years, biomass averaged for the 3 species was 5497 (se 270) g m-2 in ambient and 6450 (se 130) g m-2 in elevated [CO2] plots, a significant increase of 17% (P = 0.018). During that time, only a shallow L forest floor litter layer had formed due to intensive bioturbation. Total soil C and N contents increased irrespective of treatment and species as a result of afforestation. We could not detect an additional C sink in the soil, nor were soil C stabilization processes affected by elevated [CO2]. We observed a decrease of leaf N content in Betula and Alnus under elevated [CO2], while the soil C/N ratio decreased regardless of CO2 treatment. The ratio of N taken up from the soil and by N2-fixation in Alnus was not affected by elevated [CO2]. We infer that increased nitrogen use efficiency is the mechanism by which increased NPP is sustained under elevated [CO2] at this site. ",

We estimated the total above-ground biomass of a mature stand using tree census data obtained in a 6-ha plot every 2 years from 1994 to 1998. The total above-ground biomass decreased consistently from 1994 (431 Mg ha-1) to 1998 (403 Mg ha-1) (1 Mg = 103 kg). These are much lower than that in 1973 for a 0.2 ha portion of the same area, suggesting that the the total above-ground biomass reduction might have been consistent in recent decades. This trend contrasted with a major trend for neotropical forests. During 1994-1998, the forest gained 23.0 and 0.88 Mg ha-1 of the total above-ground biomass by tree growth and recruitment, respectively, and lost 51.9 Mg ha-1 by mortality. Overall, the biomass decreased by 28.4 Mg ha-1 (i.e. 7.10 Mg ha-1Â·year-1), which is almost equivalent to losing a 76-cm-diameter living tree per hectare per year. Analysis of positive and negative components of biomass change revealed that deaths of large trees dominated the total above-ground biomass decrease. The forest biomass also varied spatially, with the total above-ground biomass density ranging 212-655 Mg ha-1 on a 0.2-ha basis (n= 30 subplots, 1998) and 365-440 Mg ha-1 on a 1 ha basis. A large decrease of the total above-ground biomass density (> 50 Mg per ha per 2 years) in several 0.2-ha subplots contributed to the overall decrease in the 6-ha total above-ground biomass. In the present study, we discuss the association between forest dynamics and biomass fluctuation, and the implication for carbon cycling in mature forests with emphasis on forest monitoring and assessments of soil and decomposition systems.

Only the 0-year-old stand showed significantly different NEP between the two methods, suggesting a possible mismatch for the chronosequence. The spatial and methodological uncertainties allow us to say little for certain except that the stand becomes a source of C to the atmosphere following logging. ",

The respiration rates were measured by a static chamber-gas chromatograph method. Results showed that nitrogen deposition did not change the seasonal and daily variation patterns of soil respiration. Compared to the control, T(L), T(M) and T(H) treatments reduced soil annual average respiration rates by 8.51%, 9.74% and 11.24%, respectively. Meanwhile, T(L), T(M) and T(H) treatments decreased daily average soil respiration rates by 4.42%, 11.09% and 12.17%, respectively. Significant relationship was found between soil respiration rate and soil temperature. The Q10 (temperature sensitivity coefficients) for soil respiration of CK, T(L), T(M), and T(H) treatments were 2.53, 3.22, 2.64 and 2.92, respectively. Our findings suggested that nitrogen deposition reduced soil respiration, and increased soil respiration temperature sensitivity in northern subtropical deciduous broad-leave forest.",0

In the hilly area of the Loess Plateau, China, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantation forest and grassland were the two main vegetation types used to mitigate soil and water loss after cultivation abandonment. The purpose of this study was to compare the soil carbon stock and flux of these two types of vegetation which restored for 25 years. The experiment was conducted in Yangjuangou catchment in Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province, China. Two adjacent slopes were chosen for this study. Six sample sites were spaced every 35-45 m from summit to toe slope along the hill slope, and each sample site contained three sampling plots. Soil organic carbon and related physicochemical properties in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) were measured based on soil sampling and laboratory analysis, and the soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and environmental factors were measured in the same sample sites simultaneously. Results indicated that in general, a higher soil carbon stock was found in the black locust plantation forest than that in grassland throughout the hill slope. Meanwhile, significant differences in the soil carbon stock were observed between these two vegetation types in the upper slope at soil depth 0-10 cm and lower slope at soil depth 10-20 cm. The average daily values of the soil CO2 emissions were 1.27 Âµmol/(m2Â·s) and 1.39 Âµmol/(m2Â·s) for forest and grassland, respectively. The soil carbon flux in forest covered areas was higher in spring and less variation was detected between different seasons, while the highest carbon flux was found in grassland in summer, which was about three times higher than that in autumn and spring. From the carbon sequestration point of view, black locust plantation forest on hill slopes might be better than grassland because of a higher soil carbon stock and lower carbon flux.",

The difference in respiration rates derived from fine roots and the litter layer explained much of the variation of total soil respiration between the two tree species. We used an exponential equation and base temperature (10Â Â°C) to normalize soil respiration rate and its components (R10) and determined the correlation between R10 and soil moisture. Although soil moisture had a positive relationship with R10 derived from roots or litter under both C. lanceolata and M. laosensis forests, these positive correlations were masked by negative relationships between soil moisture and R10 derived from root-free soil, which resulted in a neutral correlation between total R10 and soil moisture under C. lanceolata forests. Monthly litterfall input was associated with variation in concurrent total soil respiration rate under the M. laosensis plantation and respiration rate lagging 3Â months behind under the C. lanceolata plantation, which may suggest that litterfall input from M. laosensis can more rapidly produce C substrates for microbial respiration than litterfall from C. lanceolata.ConclusionsThis study highlighted that tree species-induced variation in the quality and quantity of fine roots and litterfall can impact not only the soil respiration rate but also the seasonal variation model of forest soil respiration.",

To date there have been limited descriptions of the carbon cycle of TMCF. Aims: We present results on the production, allocation and cycling of carbon for two mid-elevation (1500-1750 m) tropical montane cloud forest plots in San Pedro, Kosnipata Valley, Peru. Methods: We repeatedly recorded the components of net primary productivity (NPP) using biometric measurements, and autotrophic (R a) and heterotrophic (R h) respiration, using gas exchange measurements. From these we estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) at the plot level. Results: The plot at 1500Â m was found very productive, with our results comparable with the most productive lowland Amazonian forests. The plot at 1750Â m had significantly lower productivity, possibly because of greater cloud immersion. Both plots had similar patterns of NPP allocation, a substantial seasonality in NPP components and little seasonality in Ra. Conclusions: These two plots lie within the ecotone between lower and upper montane forests, near the level of the cloud base. Climate change is likely to increase elevation of the cloud base, resulting in shifts in forest functioning. Longer-term surveillance of the carbon cycle at these sites would yield valuable insights into the response of TMCFs to a shifting cloud base. ",

We also evaluated the effects of burning on three key biogeochemical fluxes; litterfall, soil CO2 flux and soil net nitrogen mineralization. We found burning significantly reduced understory biomass as well as the carbon and nitrogen pools in CWD, small wood and litter. There was no significant loss of carbon and nitrogen from the fermentation, humus and soil layer probably as the result of low fire intensity. Burning resulted in a total net loss of 55Â kgÂ ha-1 nitrogen from the wood and litter layers, which should be easily replaced by future atmospheric deposition. We found a small reduction in soil CO2 flux immediately following the burn but litterfall and net nitrogen mineralization were not significantly different from controls throughout the growing season following the burn. Overall, the effects of burning on the ecosystem processes we measured were small, suggesting that prescribed burning may be an effective management tool for restoring oak-pine ecosystems in the southern Appalachians.",

Our objectives were to quantify seasonal patterns in wintertime soil CO2 flux; determine if differences in soil CO2 flux between the two forest ages during the growing season persist during winter; and to quantify the sample size necessary to discern treatment differences.

In the heavily deforested Los Tuxtlas Region of Mexico, aboveground biomass as well as aboveground and mineral soil C, N, S, and P pools were quantified in 11 secondary forest sites. These sites ranged in age from 6 mo to 50 yr following abandonment and had experienced between 1 and 30 yr of land use prior to abandonment. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased with increasing site age and ranged from 4.8 Mg/ha in a recently abandoned site to 287 Mg/ha in the 50-yr-old secondary forest site. Results indicate that secondary forests would reach TAGB levels equivalent to those of primary forests in the Los Tuxtlas Region after 73 yr. Furthermore, mean annual aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) of secondary forests was strongly and inversely related to the duration of prior land use. Aboveground pools of C, N, S, and P were also positively correlated with secondary forest age. For forests between 6 mo and 50 yr of age, C pools increased from 2 to 136 Mg/ha, N increased from 72 to 1167 kg/ha, S increased from 9 to 147 kg/ha, and P increased from 5 to 147 kg/ha. In contrast, C, N, and S pools in mineral soil to a 1-m depth remained relatively stable throughout the successional chronosequence and averaged 207, 20, and 3.4 Mg/ha, respectively. Mineral soil pools did not differ with respect to forest age or prior land use history and did not differ from soil pools of primary forest, cornfield, and pasture sites in the Los Tuxtlas Region. Dynamics of the combined aboveground and mineral soil C pools (i.e., excluding C in root biomass) were characterized by increasing contributions from aboveground pools with increasing forest age; aboveground C pools accounted for 9% and 42% of the combined pool in the youngest and oldest forests, respectively. In contrast, changes in combined aboveground and mineral soil pools of N and S during secondary succession were relatively small because >90% of N and S mass was located in mineral soil pools. ",

However, large uncertainties currently exist concerning the quantities of C and other elements lost to the atmosphere due to the conversion of primary forests to pastures and agricultural lands. Elemental losses associated with land conversion in the heavily deforested Los Tuxtlas Region of Mexico were quantified. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) as well as carbon and nutrient pools in aboveground vegetation and soils were measured along a land-use gradient that included primary forests as well as pastures and cornfields, which represent the dominant land-use types in the region. TAGB of primary forests in the Los Tuxtlas Region averaged 403 Mg/ha; pasture and cornfield sites averaged 24 and 23 Mg/ha, respectively. Approximately 80% of TAGB of forests was composed of trees >30 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh), while trees >70 cm dbh accounted for 44% of TAGB. Conversion of forests to pastures or cornfields resulted in declines of 95% of aboveground C pools, 91% of aboveground N pools, 83% of aboveground P pools, and 89-95% of aboveground S pools in sites ranging in age from 3 to 45 years since deforestation. In contrast to aboveground pools, soil pools of C, N, and S to a 1 m depth were highly variable and did not show detectable declines in pasture and cornfield sites compared to forest sites, nor did they decline with increasing periods of land use. Average C mass in soils of forest, pasture, and cornfield sites ranged between 166 and 210 Mg/ha; mass of N and S in soils ranged from 16 to 20 and from ~3 to 4 Mg/ha, respectively. Approximately 50% of the combined aboveground and soil pools of C were lost as a result of deforestation and land use. Because the vast majority (>90%) of N and S pools were present in the relatively stable pools of these young volcanic soils, less than 10% of combined aboveground and soil N and S pools were lost due to land-use change in the Los Tuxtlas Region.",

To investigate the impacts of deforestation, we quantified total aboveground biomass (TAGB), aboveground and soil pools of C and N, and soil N availability along a land-use gradient in Rondonia, Brazil, that included standing primary forest, slashed primary and secondary forest, shifting cultivation, and pasture sites. TAGB decreased substantially with increasing land use, ranging from 311 and 399 Mg ha-1 (primary forests) to 63 Mg ha-1 (pasture). Aboveground C and N pools declined in patterns and magnitudes similar to those of TAGB. Unlike aboveground pools, soil C and N concentrations and pools did not show consistent declines in response to land use. Instead, C and N concentrations were strongly related to percent clay content of soils. Concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N generally increased in soils following slash-and-burn events along the land-use gradient and decreased with increasing land use. Increasing land use resulted in marked declines in NO3-N pools relative to NH4-N pools. Rates of net nitrification and N-mineralization were also generally higher in postfire treatments relative to prefire treatments along the land-use gradient and declined with increasing land use. Results demonstrate the linked responses of aboveground C and N pools and soil N availability to land use in the Brazilian Amazon; steady reductions in aboveground pools along the land-use gradient were accompanied by declines in inorganic soil N pools and transformation rates.

The impact of changing weather and stand structure on FNEP was examined by developing relationships between FNEP and variables such as light, temperature, soil moisture, and leaf area index (LAI). In all 3 years, the stand was a large source of CO2 (620, 520, and 600 g C m-2 yr-1 in the first, second, and third years, respectively). During this period, the growth of pioneer and understory species resulted in an increase in maximum growing season LAI from 0.2 in the year the seedlings were planted to 2.5 in the third year. The associated increase in annual gross ecosystem production (P=FNEP-Re, where Re is ecosystem respiration) from 220 g C m-2 yr-1 in the first year to 640 g C m-2 yr-1 in the third year was exceeded by an increase in annual Re from 840 to 1240 g C m-2 yr-1. Seasonal and interannual variations in daytime FNEP and P were well described by variations in photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and changes in LAI. Night-time measurements of Re exponentially increased with 2 cm soil temperature with an average Q10 of 2 (relative increase in Re for a 10Â°C increase in temperature) and R10 (Re at 10Â°C) that increased from 2.1 in the first year to 2.5 in the second year to 3.2 Âµmol m-2 s-1 in the third year. Although the re-establishment of vegetation in this stand had a major impact on both P and Re, interannual variations in weather also affected annual FNEP. Drought, in the summer of the third year, resulted in early senescence and reduced both P and Re. This resulted in more C being lost from the stand in the third year after harvesting than in the second year. ",

Variability in weather, species, stand age, and current and past disturbances are some of the factors that control stand-level C dynamics. This study examines the relative roles of stand age and associated structural characteristics and weather variability on the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and three different coastal Douglas-fir stands at different stages of development after clearcut harvesting. The eddy covariance technique was used to measure carbon dioxide fluxes and a portable soil chamber system was used to measure soil respiration in the three stands located within 50Â km of each other on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. In 2002, the recently clearcut harvested stand (HDF00) was a large C source, the pole/sapling aged stand (HDF88) was a moderate C source, and the rotation-aged stand (DF49) was a moderate C sink (net ecosystem production of -606, -133, and 254Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1, respectively). Annual gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration also increased with increasing stand age. Differences in stand structural characteristics such as species composition and phenology were important in determining the timing and magnitude of maximum gross ecosystem production and net ecosystem production through the year. Both soil and ecosystem respiration were exponentially related to soil temperature in each stand with total ecosystem respiration differing more among stands than soil respiration. Between 1998 and 2003, annual net ecosystem production ranged from 254 to 424Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 over 6 years for DF49, from -623 to -564Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 over 3 years for HDF00, and from -154 to -133Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 over 2 years for HDF88. Interannual variations in C exchange of the oldest, most structurally stable stand (DF49) were related to variations in spring weather while the rapid growth of understory and pioneer species influenced variations in HDF00. The differences in net ecosystem production among stands (maximum of 1000Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 between the oldest and youngest stands) were an order of magnitude greater than the differences among years within a stand and emphasized the importance of age-related differences in stand structure on C exchange processes.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate soil-surface CO2 fluxes from drained peat under different land-use systems in Riau and Jambi Provinces, Sumatra, Indonesia. Increase of CO2 concentration was tracked in measurement chambers using an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA, LI-COR 820 model). The results showed that CO2 flux under oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations ranged from 34 Â± 16 and 45 Â± 25Â Mg CO2 ha-1Â year-1 in two locations in Jambi province to 66 Â± 25Â Mg CO2 ha-1Â year-1 for a site in Riau. For adjacent plots within 3.2Â km in the Kampar Peninsula, Riau, CO2 fluxes from an oil palm plantation, an Acacia plantation, a secondary forest and a rubber plantation were 66 Â± 25, 59 Â± 19, 61 Â± 25, 52 Â± 17Â MgÂ ha-1Â year-1, respectively, while on bare land sites it was between 56 Â± 30 and 67 Â± 24Â Mg CO2 ha-1Â year-1, indicating no significant differences among the different land-use systems in the same landscape. Unexplained site variation seems to dominate over land use in influencing CO2 flux. CO2 fluxes varied with time of day (p < 0.001) with the noon flux as the highest, suggesting an overestimate of the mean flux values with the absence of night-time measurements. In general, CO2 flux increased with the depth of water table, suggesting the importance of keeping the peat as wet as possible.",

This study presents 4 years of eddy covariance data for CO2 and water fluxes in an evergreen, old-growth tropical rain forest examining the forest's response to seasonal variations and to short-term weather anomalies. Photosynthetic efficiency declined late in the wet season, before appreciable leaf litter fall, and increased after new leaf production midway through the dry season. Rates of evapotranspiration were inelastic and did not depend on dry season precipitation. However, ecosystem respiration was inhibited by moisture limitations on heterotrophic respiration during the dry season. The annual carbon balance for this ecosystem was very close to neutral, with mean net loss of 890 Â± 220 kg C ha-1 yr-1, and a range of -221 Â± 453 (C uptake) to +2677 Â± 488 (C loss) kg C ha-1 yr-1 over 4 years. The trend from large net carbon release in 2002 towards net carbon uptake in 2005 implies recovery from prior disturbance. The annual carbon balance was sensitive to weather anomalies, particularly the timing of the dry-to-wet season transition, reflecting modulation of light inputs and respiration processes. Canopy carbon uptake rates were largely controlled by phenology and light with virtually no indication of seasonal water limitation during the 5-month dry season, indicating ample supplies of plant-available-water and ecosystem adaptation for maximum light utilization.

The land uses evaluated were degraded pasture, native pasture
and improved pasture with and without trees, fodder bank, forest
plantation, riparian forest and secondary forest. Soil samples were
taken to determine SOC and the bulk density was measured. The
amount of C stored in soil was adjusted by soil mass. Carbon in
tree biomass was estimated using temporal plots where diameter
at breast height was measured, and the carbon stored was calculated using allometric equations. The secondary forest was the land
use with more carbon stored (both in soil and trees) in Costa Rica

pasture was the land use with less carbon in all three countries.
Our results show that in the three agricultural landscapes studied,

Soil respiration was measured in five Pinus sylvestris L. plots over a period of 1Â year by means of a closed dynamic system (LI-COR 6400). Soil temperature and water content were measured at the same time as soil respiration. Other soil physico-chemical and microbiological properties were measured during the study. Measured soil respiration ranged from 6.8 to 1.4Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, showing the highest values at plots situated at higher elevation. Q 10 values ranged between 1.30 and 2.04, while R 10 values ranged between 2.0 and 3.6. The results indicate that the seasonal variation of soil respiration was mainly controlled by soil temperature and moisture. Among sites, soil carbon and nitrogen stocks regulate soil respiration in addition to soil temperature and moisture.

Red soil, one of the typical agricultural soils in subtropical China, plays important roles in the global carbon budget due to their large potential to sequester C and replenish atmospheric C through soil CO2 flux. We examined the relationship between soil CO2 flux and environmental determinants in four different land use types of subtropical red soil-paddy (P), orchard (O), woodland (W) and upland (U) using static closed chamber method. Objectives were to evaluate the relationship of soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with the soil CO2 flux. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured on each site about every 14 days between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. during 14-July 2004 to 25-April 2007 at the experimental station of Heshengqiao at Xianning, Hubei, China. Soil CO2 fluxes revealed seasonal fluctuations, with the tendency that maximum values occurred in summer, minimum in winter and intermediate values in spring and autumn except for paddy soil when it was submerged. Further, significant differences in soil CO2 fluxes were observed among the four soils, following the order of PÂ >Â OÂ >Â UÂ ~Â W. Average soil CO2 fluxes were estimated as 901Â Â±Â 114, 727Â Â±Â 55, 554Â Â±Â 22 and 533Â Â±Â 27 (Â±S.D.) gÂ CO2Â m-2Â year-1 in paddy, orchard, upland and woodland soils, respectively. Variations in soil CO2 flux were related to soil temperature, WFPS, and dissolved organic carbon with a combined R2 of 0.49-0.75. Soil temperature was an important variable controlling 26-59% of soil CO2 flux variability. The interaction of soil temperature and WFPS could explain 31-60% of soil CO2 flux variations for all the land use types. We conclude that soil CO2 flux from red soil is under environmental controls, soil temperature being the main variable, which interact with WFPS and DOC to control the supply of readily mineralizable substrates.",

Objectives were to (1) evaluate the separate and interactive relationship of TOC, MBC, MBN, DOC, and DON with soil CO2 flux, in addition to the relationship obtained by environmental variables (soil temperature and moisture), and (2) investigate the seasonal and annual CO2 fluxes from different land uses. Annual CO2 fluxes ranged from 5.4 to 9.5Â MgÂ CO2Â ha-1Â year-1. Vegetable field had the highest CO2 emission, while pine forest had significantly lower CO2 emission than cultivated land uses. Different quantities of MBC and MBN significantly regulated the CO2 emission among different land uses, relatively weakly correlated with DOC, while not being correlated with DON. However, temporal fluctuations of CO2 flux were significantly regulated by MBC, MBN, DOC and DON, in one model of variation, in all land uses. But, when all the variables were included in the multiple stepwise regression analysis, different trend of dominancy was observed for soil temperature (two sites), MBC (one site), MBN (one site), DOC (two sites) and DON (one site). Our results indicate that (1) there can be a significant shift of microbial biomass with land-use change, which in turn, caused to shift in CO2 flux, and (2) apart from the soil temperature, microbial biomass and dissolved organic substances must be considered in a warming future as these can explain a major part of temporal variation of soil CO2 fluxes.",

The data were used in conjunction with empirical models to determine which variables could be used to predict soil efflux in forests of contrasting ages and disturbance histories. Both stands experienced similar meteorological conditions with moderately cold wet winters and hot dry summers. Soil CO2 efflux at both sites showed large inter-annual variability that could be attributed to soil moisture availability in the deeper soil horizons (O site) and the quantity of summer rainfall (Y site). Seasonal patterns of soil CO2 efflux at the O site showed a strong positive correlation between diel mean soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature at 64 cm depth whereas diel mean soil efflux at the Y site declined before maximum soil temperature occurred during summer drought. The use of diel mean soil temperature and soil water potential inferred from predawn foliage water potential measurements could account for 80% of the variance of diel mean soil efflux across 3 years at both sites, however, the functional shape of the soil water potential constraint was site-specific. Based on the similarity of the decomposition rates of litter and fine roots between sites, but greater productivity and amount of fine litter detritus available for decomposition at the O site, we would expect higher rates of soil CO2 efflux at the O site. However, annual rates were only higher at the O site in one of the 3 years (597 Â± 45 vs. 427 Â± 80 g C m-2). Seasonal patterns of soil efflux at both sites showed influences of soil water limitations that were also reflected in patterns of canopy stomatal conductance, suggesting strong linkages between above and below ground processes.

By regularly watering part of the root system to reduce tree water stress and measuring soil CO2 efflux on the dry, distant side of the tree, we were able to determine the strength of the relationship between soil autotrophic (root and rhizosphere) respiration and changes in canopy carbon uptake and water loss by comparison with control trees (no watering). After ~40Â days the soil CO2 efflux rate, relative to pre-treatment conditions, was twice that of the controls. This difference, attributable to root and rhizosphere respiration, was strongly correlated with differences in transpiration rates between treatments (r2Â =Â 0.73, p<0.01). By the end of the period, transpiration of the irrigated treatment was twice that of controls. Periodic measurements of photosynthesis under non-light limited conditions paralleled the patterns of transpiration and were systematically higher in the irrigated treatment. We observed no evidence for a greater sensitivity of soil autotrophic respiration to temperature compared to the response of heterotrophic respiration to temperature; the Q10 for total soil respiration was 1.6 (p>0.99) for both treatments. At the ecosystem scale, daily soil CO2 efflux rate was linearly related to gross primary productivity (GPP) as measured by eddy-covariance technique (r2Â =Â 0.55, p<0.01), suggesting patterns of soil CO2 release appear strongly correlated to recent carbon assimilation in this young pine stand.

Interannual variability of Fs was large (CV=17%) with a range of 427 g C m-2 yr-1 around a mean annual Fs of 811 g C m-2 yr-1. On average, 76% of the variation of daily mean Fs could be quantified using an empirical model with year-specific basal respiration rate that was a linear function of tree basal area increment (BAI) and modulated by a common response to soil temperature and moisture. Interannual variability in Fs could be attributed almost equally to interannual variability in BAI (a proxy for above-ground productivity) and interannual variability in soil climate. Seasonal total Fs was twice as sensitive to soil moisture variability during the summer months compared with temperature variability during the same period and almost insensitive to the natural range of interannual variability in spring temperatures. A strong seasonality in both root respiration (Rr) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) was observed with the fraction attributed to Rr steadily increasing from 18% in mid-March to 50% in early June through early July before dropping rapidly to 10% of Fs by mid-August. The seasonal pattern in Rr (10-day averages) was strongly linearly correlated with tree transpiration (r2=0.90, P<0.01) as measured using sap flux techniques and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP, r2=0.83, P<0.01) measured by the eddy-covariance approach. Rr increased by 0.43 g C m-2 day-1 for every 1 g C m-2 day-1 increase in GEP. The strong linear correlation of Rr to seasonal changes in GEP and transpiration combined with longer-term interannual variability in the base rate of Fs, as a linear function of BAI (r2=0.64, P=0.06), provides compelling justification for including canopy processes in future models of Fs.

The model can be characterized in three ways. (1) It is a compartment model. Ecosystem carbon storage is divided into five compartments; foliage, stem, root, litter, and mineral soil. This approach made the model simple and sound, and allowed us to run the model on a broad scale; indeed, the simulation in this paper was performed using data available at the global scale. (2) It is a process-based model. Sim-CYCLE estimates net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) by explicitly calculating such carbon fluxes as gross primary production (GPP), plant respiration, and soil decomposition on a monthly time-step; these fluxes are regulated by a multitude of environmental factors at the physiological scale. In relation to global change, responses to increased atmospheric CO2 and temperature should be modeled in a mechanistic manner. (3) It is a prognostic model. Sim-CYCLE is designed to be applicable not only to the simulation of an equilibrium state under given conditions, but also to the prediction of a transitional state under changing environmental conditions. Importantly, Sim-CYCLE is based on the dry-matter production theory, which enabled us to achieve the scaling-up from single-leaf to canopy and to conceptualize the growth process. Since the model includes both radiation and hydrological conditions, some indirect influences of the initial environmental change can be properly evaluated. We present a comprehensive model description and preliminary results confirmed at the plot scale: (1) intensively in four natural ecosystems and (2) extensively in global 21 sites. At each site, model parameters were calibrated to capture the observed carbon dynamics (e.g. productivity and carbon storage) at the equilibrium state. Successional growth patterns and seasonal variations in CO2 exchange were also examined in a qualitative manner. Sim-CYCLE successfully expressed the differences between tropical forest and boreal forest and between humid forest and arid grassland in terms of productivity and carbon storage. Next, we simulated transitional ecosystem carbon dynamics, in response to step-wise atmospheric CO2 doubling and disturbance regime. The simulated temporal patterns of carbon cycle were realistic and ensured that Sim-CYCLE is an effective tool for predicting the impact of global change.",

After six months exposure to elevated CO2, root production measured by root in-growth bags, showed significant increases in mean total root length and biomass, which were more than 100% greater compared to the ambient treatment. This increased root length may have lead to a more intensive soil exploration. Chemical analysis of the roots showed that the roots in the elevated treatment accumulated more starch and had a lower C/N-ratio. Specific root respiration rates were significantly higher in the elevated treatment and this was probably attributed to increased nitrogen concentrations in the roots. Rhizospheric respiration and soil CO2 efflux were also enhanced in the elevated treatment. These results clearly indicate that under elevated atmospheric CO2 root production and development in Scots pine seedlings is altered and respiratory carbon losses through the root system are increased.

Energy balance closure was adequately good at both levels. As compared with what is usually observed at this site the ecosystem dissipated less energy via latent heat flux and more via sensible heat flux. The understorey canopy was responsible for a variable, significant component of the whole canopy fluxes of water vapour and carbon dioxide. The annual contribution of the understorey was 38% (154Â mm) of the overall evaporation (399Â mm) and 32% (89Â mm) of the overall sensible heat flux (274Â mm). The participation of the understorey reached 45% of the overall evaporation and 30% of the daytime overall assimilation during significant soil water deficit periods in summertime. Even during winter, understorey photosynthesis was consistent as it compensated soil and understorey respiration. The ecosystem behaved as a sink of carbon, with a negative annual carbon budget (-57Â gÂ CÂ m-2). However, due to high soil water deficit, the annual ecosystem GPP was 40% less than usually observed at this site. This budget resulted from a sink of -131Â gÂ CÂ m-2 for the overstorey and a source of +74Â gÂ CÂ m-2 for the understorey. Moreover, on an annual basis the overstorey layer contributed to almost two-thirds of the ecosystem respiration. Finally, the effect of long-lasting soil water deficit on the maritime pine forest was found more important than the effect of the heat wave and drought of summer 2003.",

We used small solid-state infrared CO2 sensors for long-term continuous real-time measurement of CO2 concentrations at different depths, and measured half-hourly soil CO2 effluxes with an automated non-steady-state chamber. We describe a simple steady-state method to measure CO2 diffusivity in undisturbed soil cores. The method accounts for the CO2 production in the soil and uses an analytical solution to the diffusion equation. The diffusivity was related to air-filled porosity by a power law function, which was independent of soil depth. CO2 concentration at all depths increased with increase in soil temperature, likely due to a rise in CO2 production, and with increase in soil water content due to decreased diffusivity or increased CO2 production or both. It also increased with soil depth reaching almost 10Â mmolÂ mol-1 at the 50-cm depth. Annually, soil CO2 efflux was best described by an exponential function of soil temperature at the 5-cm depth, with the reference efflux at 10Â Â°C (F10) of 2.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and the Q10 of 3.7. No evidence of displacement of CO2-rich soil air with rain was observed.Effluxes calculated from soil CO2 concentration gradients near the surface closely agreed with the measured effluxes. Calculations indicated that more than 75% of the soil CO2 efflux originated in the top 20Â cm soil. Calculated CO2 production varied with soil temperature, soil water content and season, and when scaled to 10Â Â°C also showed some diurnal variation. Soil CO2 efflux and concentrations as well as soil temperature at the 5-cm depth varied in phase. Changes in CO2 storage in the 0-50Â cm soil layer were an order of magnitude smaller than measured effluxes. Soil CO2 efflux was proportional to CO2 concentration at the 50-cm depth with the slope determined by soil water content, which was consistent with a simple steady-state analytical model of diffusive transport of CO2 in the soil. The latter proved successful in calculating effluxes during 2004.",

Seasonal variation in both Rs and Re was better predicted by soil temperature at the 5Â cm depth than at any other depth and air temperature. Re was more responsive than Rs to changes in temperature and soil water content. While nighttime (Rsn) and daytime (Rsd) soil respiration showed no difference in their response to soil temperature, daytime ecosystem respiration (Red) was less responsive than its nighttime counterpart (Ren) to changes in soil temperature. Half-hourly Red was almost always smaller than Ren possibly due to photoinhibition while daily total Red was higher than daily total Ren during summer and spring months but smaller in winter and autumn months with the latter due to fewer daylight hours. A distinct seasonal pattern in the Rs to Re ratio was observed. The 3-year mean seasonal Rs/Re was at its minimum of 0.52 in spring followed by 0.63 in summer, 0.81 in autumn and a maximum of 0.86 in winter. Both daily total and half-hourly Rsd/Red were larger than Rsn/Ren. It appears that the different responses of Rs and Re to environmental variables arise as a result of seasonal variations in photosynthesis, mobilization and use of stored carbohydrates, and differences in the phenology of aboveground and belowground plant tissues. On an annual basis, Rs accounted for 62% of Re with the latter accounting for 86% of the carbon (C) assimilated in annual photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP), leaving the net C sequestration efficiency (1Â -Â Re/GPP) at 14%. In the relatively dry year of 2003, both Rs and Re as well as GPP were the lowest but with the highest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the 3 years. The relatively wetter growing season soil moisture regime in 2005 resulted in the highest Re and GPP. Partitioning of Rs into its autotrophic and heterotrophic components indicated that 54% of GPP was respired back to the atmosphere as autotrophic respiration and an additional 32% was lost in the decomposition of litterfall and soil organic matter.

For soil water content at the 4 cm depth (<U+03B8>) > 0.11 m3 m-3 (corresponding to a soil water matric potential of -2 MPa), RS was positively correlated to soil temperature at the 2 cm depth (TS). Below this value of <U+03B8>, however, RS was largely decoupled from TS, and evapotranspiration, ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity (GPP) began to decrease, dropping to about half of their maximum values when <U+03B8> reached 0.07 m3 m-3. Soil water deficit substantially reduced RS sensitivity to temperature resulting in a Q10 significantly < 2. The absolute temperature sensitivity of RS (i.e. dRS/dTS) increased with <U+03B8> up to 0.15 m3 m-3, above which it slowly declined. The value of dRS/dTS was nearly 0 for <U+03B8> < 0.08 m3 m-3, thereby confirming that RS was largely unaffected by temperature under soil water stress conditions. Despite the possible effects of seasonality of photosynthesis, root activity and litterfall on RS, the observed decrease in its temperature sensitivity at low <U+03B8> was consistent with the reduction in substrate availability due to a decrease in (a) microbial mobility, and diffusion of substrates and extracellular enzymes, and (b) the fraction of substrate that can react at high TS, which is associated with low <U+03B8>. We found that an exponential (van't Hoff type) model with Q10 and R10 dependent on only <U+03B8> explained 92% of the variance in half-hourly values of RS, including the period with soil water stress conditions. We hypothesize that relating Q10 and R10 to <U+03B8> not only accounted for the effects of TS on RS and its temperature sensitivity but also accounted for the seasonality of biotic (photosynthesis, root activity, and litterfall) and abiotic (soil moisture and temperature) controls and their interactions.

Fertilizer application took place in January 2007, aerially at 200Â kgÂ urea-NÂ ha-1 in 19- and 59-year-old stands (hereafter referred to HDF88 and DF49, respectively), and manually at 80Â g urea per tree (60Â kgÂ NÂ ha-1) along the tree drip line in a 7-year-old stand (HDF00). N fertilization substantially increased foliar N content as well as needle mass in all the three stands leading to N-sufficiency compared to severe N-deficiency in similar trees in the adjacent unfertilized areas of the respective stands. In the absence of a second EC flux tower in similar unfertilized stands, we used simple empirical models fitted to multi-year pre-fertilization monthly fluxes to calculate C and water fluxes for 2007 and 2008 assuming the stands were not fertilized and compared these with measured fluxes to determine the effects of fertilization. Our modelling analysis suggested that fertilization increased GPP and R in all the three stands with increases in GPP being greater than R in DF49 and HDF88 but smaller than R in HDF00. Fertilizer-induced increase in net C sequestration or NEP was the highest (182 and 179Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively) in HDF88 followed by DF49 (168 and 78Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively) and small decreases (-3 and -82Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively) in HDF00. Fertilization resulted in an insignificant increase in E in all the three stands, thereby resulting in substantial increase in water use efficiency (GPP/E) in the younger (HDF88 and HDF00) stands but little effect in the intermediate-aged (DF49) stand. Tree ring analysis for DF49 showed that fertilization increased bole volume above that in an adjacent unfertilized control area by about 5.0 and 8.0Â m3Â ha-1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively.",

Forest-floor CO2 efflux (Rs) measurements were made continuously with an automated non-steady-state chamber system as well as at 2-4 weekly intervals with manual non-steady-state chambers. Soil N2O flux was measured using the static chamber technique. Soil CO2 efflux measurements were made (a) in a completely-randomized design field experiment with four replications of fertilization and trenching treatments, (b) in soil columns in the laboratory, and (c) as a part of long-term flux monitoring in the field, using an automated chamber, for four years before fertilization and two years post-fertilization. Another field experiment compared the effect of regular urea and a slow-release-urea (Environmentally Smart N (ESN)) on forest-floor CO2 and N2O fluxes. We also studied the effects of N fertilization on decomposition of a standard substrate in the field. Our field measurements showed that N fertilization resulted in a significant short-term (over 3-4Â months) increase in Rs due to an increase in autotrophic (or rhizospheric) soil respiration after which a small decrease in heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) was observed. However, our laboratory measurements showed that N application had no effect on Rh in mineral soil, but a small but consistent increase for 10Â weeks when the mineral soil had an LFH (litter-fibric-humus) layer on the surface. Fertilization resulted in significant N2O emissions in the first year with its peak rate almost coinciding with peak CO2 emissions. In the second year, however, we found no N2O emissions, but rather a small uptake in all treatments. The increase in Rs with N addition generally continued until N2O emissions began to decline, suggesting that most of the applied urea-N was rendered unavailable within the first 4Â months. The results further suggest the lack of bioavailable C and hence insignificant microbial immobilization of applied N, because otherwise the latter would have resulted in an appreciable increase in Rh.",

We measured the effects of winter application of 200Â kgÂ NÂ ha-Â 1 to a near-end-of-rotation coastal Douglas-fir stand on soil CH4 and N2O fluxes, soil and bole respiration (Rs and Rb, respectively), and soil CH4 and N2O concentrations. Fertilization resulted in a significant decrease in CH4 uptake and changed a small uptake of N2O to significant emissions. Based on the average reduction of 2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â h-Â 1 in CH4 uptake with N fertilization, from an average of 4Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â h-Â 1 with no N fertilization, the approximate first-year annual reduction was estimated to be 2.8Â kgÂ CH4Â ha-Â 1. In comparison, net annual increase in N2O emissions with N fertilization was 17.6Â kgÂ N2OÂ ha-Â 1. Calculations showed that fertilizer-induced net GHG emissions due to the reduction in CH4 uptake and the increase in N2O emissions was 0.07 and 5.3Â tÂ CO2Â ha-Â 1 equivalents (CO2_Eqv), respectively, indicating that the reduction in CH4 uptake was much less important than the increase in N2O emissions. Contrary to expectation, the annual loss of 17.6Â kgÂ N2OÂ ha-Â 1 arising from this winter application of N was slightly higher than the 15.7Â kgÂ N2OÂ ha-Â 1 loss following spring application of N in the previous year. N fertilization also resulted in small increase in soil respiration, confirming our previous results. Temporal dynamics of Rb matched those of soil respiration and N2O fluxes. Fertilization resulted in a small but persistent increase in Rb over the first 4-5Â months. While soil temperature was the main control of soil N2O and CO2 fluxes as well as Rb, CH4 uptake was better correlated to soil water content, i.e., soil gas diffusivity and gas exchange with the atmosphere.",

Rs in the younger stand, HDF88 was more responsive to changes in soil temperature (Ts) and volumetric soil water content (<U+03B8>). While daily Rs in HDF88 increased with Ts, reached a maximum at Ts of 12Â Â°C and then decreased, it increased nearly exponentially at DF49 throughout the range of measured Ts. The decrease in Rs at TsÂ >Â 12Â Â°C at HDF88 was attributed to soil water stress.Time series analysis revealed that a photosynthetic signal (from eddy-covariance-measured gross ecosystem photosynthesis (Pg)) in chamber-measured Rs appeared at different temporal scales in the two stands. On the seasonal scale, no lags were observed between daily Rs and daily Pg during the active growing season of mid March to October at both sites. On the diurnal scale, half-hourly Rs values lagged behind half-hourly Pg by 7Â h, which corresponded closely with the diurnal lag of Ts behind solar irradiance. The diurnal lag of Rs behind Pg corresponded closely to that of heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) with the autotrophic component (Rs - Rh) showing little diurnal response to Pg and also to Ts. Furthermore, at any given Ts, daily Rs showed no response to daily Pg at both sites, especially when soil water content was non-limiting. There was no need to invoke a delay in biological transport of photosynthates in the phloem or physical transport of CO2 in the soil to explain Rs lags behind Pg in these temperate coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems.",

A total of 2300 emission measurements were taken at 144 locations, over a 2 year period. The autotrophic root respiration component of CO2 emission was separated from heterotrophic emission caused by peat oxidation in three ways: (i) by comparing CO2 emissions within and beyond the tree rooting zone, (ii) by comparing CO2 emissions with and without peat trenching (i.e. cutting any roots remaining in the peat beyond the tree rooting zone), and (iii) by comparing CO2 emissions before and after Acacia tree harvesting. On average, the contribution of autotrophic respiration to daytime CO2 emission was 21% along transects in mature tree stands. At locations 0.5 m from trees this was up to 80% of the total emissions, but it was negligible at locations more than 1.3 m away. This means that CO2 emission measurements well away from trees were free of any autotrophic respiration contribution and thus represent only heterotrophic emissions. We found daytime mean annual CO2 emission from peat oxidation alone of 94 t ha-1 y-1 at a mean water table depth of 0.8 m, and a minimum emission value of 80 t ha-1 y-1 after correction for the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuations, which may result in a 14.5% reduction of the daytime emission. There is a positive correlation between mean long-term water table depth and peat oxidation CO2 emission. However, no such relation is found for instantaneous emission/water table depth within transects and it is clear that factors other than water table depth also affect peat oxidation and total CO2 emissions. The increase in the temperature of the surface peat due to plantation establishment may explain over 50% of peat oxidation emissions. Our study sets a standard for greenhouse gas flux studies from tropical peatlands under different forms of agricultural land management. It is the first to purposefully quantify heterotrophic CO2 emissions resulting from tropical peat decomposition by separating these from autotrophic emissions. It also provides the most scientifically- and statistically-rigorous study to date of CO2 emissions resulting from anthropogenic modification of this globally significant carbon rich ecosystem. Our findings indicate that past studies have underestimated emissions from peatland plantations, with important implications for the scale of greenhouse gas emissions arising from land use change, particularly in the light of current, rapid agricultural conversion of peatlands in the Southeast Asian region.

However, SR and associated edaphic factors have not been widely studied in semi-arid regions. In this study, SR was measured in a riparian zone and the effect of soil temperature and soil moisture on SR was examined under five forest species of the semi-arid region. The mean daily SR rate was 1.82, 2.08, 2.35, 2.27 and 2.07 g C m?2 d?1 in Jatropha curcas, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora sites respectively. It was found that SR was significantly and positively correlated with soil moisture. A univariate model of sub-surface soil moisture could explain 77% of temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux, irrespective of species and sites. The logarithmic model could best explain the relationship between SR and soil moisture at 10–20 cm of soil depth (P < 0.001). There were negative correlations between SR and soil temperature under majority of species. Overall, across all species, soil temperature poorly explained 26% variation in SR as independent variable. For SR rate–temperature relationship, a bell-shaped function gave the best fit in this ecosystem. Under all the species, SR increases with increase in soil temperature up to 33°C (± 2); thereafter it decreases gradually under all species. There was strong evidence that deficit of soil moisture rather than soil temperature was the main regulating factor of SR under the semi-arid ecosystems.",1

Progress on these issues will contribute to reduced uncertainties in carbon cycle modeling. We monitored soil CO2 efflux with an automated chamber system in a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation near Beijing throughout 2011. Soil temperature at 10-cm depth (Ts) exerted a strong control over Rs, with the annual temperature sensitivity (Q10) and basal rate at 10Â°C (Rs10) being 2.76 and 1.40 Âµmol m-2 s-1, respectively. Both Rs and short-term (i.e., daily) estimates of Rs10 showed pronounced seasonal hysteresis with respect to Ts, with the efflux in the second half of the year being larger than that early in the season for a given temperature. The hysteresis may be associated with the confounding effects of microbial population dynamics and/or litter input. As a result, all of the applied regression models failed to yield unbiased estimates of Rs over the entire annual cycle. Lags between Rs and Ts were observed at the diel scale in the early and late growing season, but not in summer. The seasonality in these lags may be due to the use of a single Ts measurement depth, which failed to represent seasonal changes in the depth of CO2 production. Daily estimates of Q10 averaged 2.04, smaller than the value obtained from the seasonal relationship. In addition, daily Q10 decreased with increasing Ts, which may contribute feedback to the climate system under global warming scenarios. The use of a fixed, universal Q10 is considered adequate when modeling annual carbon budgets across large spatial extents. In contrast, a seasonally-varying, environmentally-controlled Q10 should be used when short-term accuracy is required. ",

The three forest sites include Masson pine forest (PF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (BF). Our observations showed that altered precipitation strongly influenced soil respiration, not only through the well-known direct effects of soil moisture on plant and microbial activities, but also by modification of both moisture and temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. In the dry season, soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity, as well as fine root and soil microbial biomass, showed rising trends with precipitation increases in the three forest sites. Contrarily, the moisture sensitivity of soil respiration decreased with precipitation increases. In the wet season, different treatments showed different effects in three forest sites. The EP treatment decreased fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass, soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity, but enhanced soil moisture sensitivity in all three forest sites. The DP treatment significantly increased soil respiration, fine root and soil microbial biomass in the PF only, and no significant change was found for the soil temperature sensitivity. However, the DP treatment in the MF and BF reduced soil temperature sensitivity significantly in the wet season. Our results indicated that soil respiration would decrease in the three subtropical forests if soil moisture continues to decrease in the future. More rainfall in the wet season could have limited effect on the response of soil respiration to the rising of temperature in the BF and MF. ",

To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured the standing crop fine root mass and the production of fine roots (<2 mm) by two methods: (1) ingrowth cores and, (2) sequential soil coring, during 2.2 years in two lowland forests growing on different soils types in the Colombian Amazon. Differences of soil resources were defined by the type and physical and chemical properties of soil: a forest on clay loam soil (Endostagnic Plinthosol) at the Amacayacu National Natural Park and, the other on white sand (Ortseinc Podzol) at the Zafire Biological Station, located in the Forest Reservation of the Calderon River. We found that the standing crop fine root mass and the production was significantly different between soil depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) and also between forests. The loamy sand forest allocated more carbon to fine roots than the clay loam forest with the production in loamy sand forest twice (meanÂ±standard error=2.98Â±0.36 and 3.33Â±0.69 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, method 1 and 2, respectively) as much as for the more fertile loamy soil forest (1.51Â±0.14, method 1, and from 1.03Â±0.31 to 1.36Â±0.23 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, method 2). Similarly, the average of standing crop fine root mass was higher in the white-sands forest (10.94Â±0.33 Mg C ha-1) as compared to the forest on the more fertile soil (from 3.04Â±0.15 to 3.64Â±0.18 Mg C ha-1). The standing crop fine root mass also showed a temporal pattern related to rainfall, with the production of fine roots decreasing substantially in the dry period of the year 2005. These results suggest that soil resources may play an important role in patterns of carbon allocation to the production of fine roots in these forests as the proportion of carbon allocated to above- and below-ground organs is different between forest types. Thus, a trade-off between above- and below-ground growth seems to exist with our results also suggesting that there are no differences in total net primary productivity between these two forests, but with higher below-ground production and lower above-ground production for the forest on the nutrient poor soil.

We focused on three likely influences on ABA for which data are readily available: climate, soil texture, and forest type. Growing-season degree-years (GSDY, stand age x growing-season length x growing-season temperature) generally predicted ABA better than stand age alone. Using regression analyses and slope homogeneity tests, we determined that broadleaf forest plots on sandy textured soils exhibited slower GSDY-adjusted ABA than those on nonsandy soils. On nonsandy soils, the GSDY-adjusted ABAs of tropical and nontropical plots were indistinguishable; tropical forest post-disturbance ABA was not particularly slow. Compared to broadleaf forests, needle-leaf forest, GSDY-adjusted ABA was less sensitive to soil texture and was intermediate in rate between sandy and nonsandy broadleaf forest ABA. Foliar nutrient concentration did not significantly influence the GSDY-adjusted ABA of a subset of the nonsandy broadleaf forests for which foliar nutrient data were available.

Aboveground biomass growth responses to the combined fertilizer and weed control treatments (FW) averaged ~2- and 2.8-fold for slash and loblolly pine, respectively. In the same treatment, annual needlefall (NF) production for slash pine approached a ""steady state"" of 6 MgÂ·ha-1 at ages 8-14 years, while loblolly pine NF production peaked at 7 MgÂ·ha-1 at age 10 years, and then declined 17% following curtailment of the fertilizer treatment. Periodic stemwood biomass increment (PAI) for the FW treatment for both species culminated at about 15 MgÂ·ha-1Â·year-1 at age 8 years and then declined rapidly (~275%) to <4 MgÂ·ha-1Â·year-1 at 15 years; reductions for the untreated control were considerably slower. The progressive decline in PAI following peak leaf area development was closely associated with a decrease in stemwood production per unit leaf area (growth efficiency). A unit increase in leaf area index in the 7- to 9-year-old stands produced about 3.0 and 3.1 times more stemwood biomass per year than in the 14- to 16-year-old stands for loblolly and slash pine, respectively.",

This study presents a large-scale water manipulation experiment simulating changes in precipitation variability, aiming at a better understanding of the effects of rainfall patterns on soil C and N cycling and understorey productivity in a Mediterranean oak woodland.MethodsWe used rain-out shelters to achieve (1) a normal dry period (7Â days), and (2) a dry period increased three-fold (21Â days), without altering total annual precipitation inputs.ResultsThe temporal patterns of soil respiration (R s) and soil inorganic N were not affected by treatment. However, water infiltration and N leaching increased with large infrequent watering events. R s and soil NH4+-N correlated with soil temperature, with soil NO3--N being influenced by leaching.ConclusionsThe lack of significant treatment effects on either R s or soil inorganic N can be explained by (1) minor differences in plant productivity between the treatments, suggesting equal plant N demand, and (2) the absence of moisture dependence of R s and soil NH4+-N. Increased N leaching with large infrequent precipitation events may have longer-term consequences for ecosystem functioning. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of possible climate change effects on key ecosystem processes in Mediterranean ecosystems.",

Its variability on multiple time scales strongly depends on environmental variables such as temperature and moisture. To investigate the temporal variations of Rsoil in a cool-temperate oak (Quercus mongolica) forest at the Nam-San site in Seoul, Korea, continuous measurements of Rsoil using the automated chamber systems, air and soil temperatures and soil moisture are made for the period from April 2010 to March 2011. The observed data indicate that the Rsoil shows a remarkable seasonal variation in accordance with temperatures with high in summer and low in winter. The Rsoil is found to be strongly correlated with soil temperature (Ts) at the 5Â cm depth throughout the year. However, the high fluctuation of Rsoil is found to be related with soil moisture content (Ms) during the forest growing season. The estimated annual Q10 value using the 1.5Â m-high air temperature is found to be 2.4 that is comparable with other studies in temperate forest ecosystems. The optimal regression equation of Rsoil with the Ts at 5Â cm depth and the Ms at 15Â cm depth is found to be RsoilÂ =Â 124.3 exp (0.097Ts)Â -Â 55.3 (Ms)2Â +Â 2931.9 (Ms)Â -Â 38516 for TsÂ =Â 0Â Â°C and RsoilÂ =Â 0 for TsÂ <Â 0Â Â°C with r2Â =Â 0.97, PÂ <Â 0.01, suggesting the importance of Ts and Ms for Rsoil.

An earlier study utilized a constrained source optimization (CSO) method using inverse Lagrangian dispersion theory to infer the two components of ecosystem respiration (aboveground and forest floor) from measured mean CO2 concentration profiles within the canopy. This method required measurements of within-canopy mean velocity statistics and did not consider local thermal stratification. We propose a Eulerian version of the CSO method (CSOE) to account for local thermal stratification within the canopy for momentum and scalars using higher-order closure principles. This method uses simultaneous mean CO2 concentration and air temperature profiles within the canopy and velocity statistics above the canopy as inputs. The CSOE was tested at a maturing loblolly pine plantation over a 3-year period with a mild drought (2001), a severe drought (2002), and a wet year (2003). Annual forest floor efflux modeled with CSOE averaged 111 g C m-2 less than that estimated using chambers during these years (2001: 1224 versus 1328 gCm-2; 2002: 1127 versus 1230 gCm-2; 2003: 1473 versus 1599 gCm-2). The modeled ecosystem respiration exceeded estimates from eddy covariance measurements (uncorrected for storage fluxes) by at least 25%, even at high friction velocities. Finally, we showed that the CSOE annual nighttime respiration values agree well with independent estimates derived from the intercept of the ecosystem light-response curve from daytime eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements.

On average, 57 and 14 chambers were required to obtain 10% and 20% margins of error at the 95% confidence level, while 38 and 9 chambers were required for these 2 error margins at the 90% confidence level, respectively. Thus, our data were in the range of the 20% margin of error at the 95% confidence level. ANOVA statistical tests also separated the minimum required measurement interval into two groups using Q10 values based on actual measured temperatures: (1) short-term sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days and (2) long-term intervals of 7, 14, 20, and 30 days.

Rupr. forest (240-280 years old) established on permafrost soils in central Siberia. Specifically, we investigated annual carbon budgets in roots in relation to root system development and availability of soil resources. Total stand biomass estimated by allometry was about 39 Mg ha-1. Root biomass (17 Mg ha-1) comprised about 43% of total biomass. Coarse root (= 5 mm in diameter) biomass was about twice that of fine roots (< 5 mm). The aboveground biomass/root biomass ratio (T/R) of the larch stand was about unity, which is much less than that of other boreal and subalpine conifer forests. The proportion of fine roots in total root biomass (35%) was relatively high compared with other cold-climate evergreen conifer forests. Total NPP, defined as the sum of annual biomass increment of woody parts and needle biomass, was estimated to be 1.8 Mg ha-1 year-1. Allocation of total NPP to needle production was 56%. The proportion of total NPP in belowground production (27%) was less than for evergreen taiga forests. However, belowground NPP was probably underestimated because root mortality was excluded. We conclude that L. gmelinii trees invested annual carbon gains largely into needle production or roots, or both, at the expense of growth of aboveground woody parts. This carbon allocation pattern, which resulted in the construction of exploitative root networks, appeared to be a positive growth response to the nutrient-poor permafrost soil of central Siberia.",

Rupr. and Larix cajanderi Mayer) that grow on the continuous permafrost regions in Siberia. Sample tree data (total nÂ =Â 27) gathered from four mature stands (>100 years old) were employed for analysis. First, to determine good size predictor of biomass, site-specific allometric relationships (log-linear equation form) were derived between dry mass of four components (stem, branch, needle and coarse root; =5Â mm in diameter) and seven size variables; stem diameters (breast height, 30Â cm height and crown base), sapwood areas (breast height and 30Â cm height), and two combined-variables (tree heightÂ xÂ diameter). For all components, site-specific allometric equations based on breast-height diameter (D) always gave high correlations as those using other size variables. However, between-stand comparisons of the D-base site-specific allometry indicated that size dependency (i.e., regression slope) differed for stem mass. Besides, needle and coarse root mass for a given size (i.e., regression intercept) differed significantly among the four stands. These facts implied that D-base regression model was reliable for biomass estimation by site-specific allometry, but was not suitable for developing general (i.e., site-common) allometry. Second, to examine carbon allocation pattern, we estimated each stand biomass by applying corresponding site-specific D-base allometry. Stand total biomass ranged from 8.6 to 33.1Â MgÂ ha-1, and aboveground-total/coarse root biomass ratio (i.e., T/R) ranged from 1.5 to 2.6. The variation was mainly due to trade-offs between stem and root biomass. Average T/R was about 2.3 that was calculated for some reported L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi stands (nÂ =Â 16), including our four stands. This average T/R was extremely small in comparison to that (5.1) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on the non- or discontinuous permafrost regions in Siberia. This finding strongly suggested that the two Larix species invested annual carbon gains largely into root growth. We discussed its ecological implications in relation to stand structure and permafrost soil-N conditions in the larch taiga ecosystem.",

The dynamics of these interactions with respect to wildland fire are often difficult to understand and identify at short temporal scales. Dendrochronological fire histories from the Missouri Ozarks, coupled with human population data, offer a quantitative means of examining historic (1680-1990) changes in the anthropogenic fire regime. A temporal analysis of fire scar dates over the last 3 centuries indicates that the percent of sites burned and fire intervals of anthropogenic fires are conditioned by the following four limiting factors: (a) anthropogenic ignition, (b) surface fuel production, (c) fuel fragmentation, and (d) cultural behavior. During an ignition-dependent stage (fewer than 0.64 humans/km2), the percent of sites burned is logarithmically related to human population (r 2 = 0.67). During a fuel-limited stage, where population density exceeds a threshold of 0.64 humans/km2, the percent of sites burned is independent of population increases and is limited by fuel production. During a fuel-fragmentation stage, regional trade allows population densities to increase above 3.4 humans/km2, and the percent of sites burned becomes inversely related to population (r 2 = 0.18) as decreases in fuel continuity limit the propagation of surface fires. During a culture-dependent stage, increases in the value of timber over forage greatly reduce the mean fire interval and the percent of sites burned. Examples of the dynamics of these four stages are presented from the Current River watershed of the Missouri Ozarks. ",

To examine this, we estimated WSOC fluxes based on measured concentrations along four replicate gradients in upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) productivity and soil temperature in interior Alaska and compared them to concurrent rates of soil CO2 efflux. Concentrations of WSOC in organic and mineral horizons ranged from 4.9 to 22.7Â gÂ CÂ m-2 and from 1.4 to 8.4Â gÂ CÂ m-2, respectively. Annual WSOC fluxes (4.5-12.0Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1) increased with annual soil CO2 effluxes (365-739Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1) across all sites (R2=0.55, p=0.02), with higher fluxes occurring in warmer, more productive stands. Although annual WSOC flux was relatively small compared to total soil CO2 efflux across all sites (<3%), its relative contribution was highest in warmer, more productive stands which harbored less soil organic carbon. The proportions of relatively bioavailable organic fractions (hydrophilic organic matter and low molecular weight acids) were highest in WSOC in colder, low-productivity stands whereas the more degraded products of microbial activity (fulvic acids) were highest in warmer, more productive stands. These data suggest that WSOC mineralization may be a mechanism for increased soil C loss if the climate warms and therefore should be accounted for in order to accurately determine the sensitivity of boreal soil organic C balance to climate change.",

The changing climate scenario assumed increases in mean annual temperature of 0.4Â°C per decade for the first one hundred years and 0.2Â°C per decade for the second hundred years. Warming was assumed to be larger during the winter than during the other seasons.In southern Finland, the long term average (over 200 years) net forest ecosystem production (NEP) at the stand level was 0.4-1.0 Mg C/ha/a under the current climatic conditions, and 0.1-0.9 Mg C/ha/a under changing conditions, depending on the tree species. Under the climate change scenario, NEP decreased in Scots pine, Norway spruce and Pubescent birch stands, but increased in Pendula birch stands. During the first 25-50 years, however, NEP was found to be larger both in Scots pine and Pubescent birch stands. In northern Finland, the long term average NEP increaed, regardless of tree species, from 0.3-0.8 Mg C/ha/a to 0.4-1.0 Mg C/ha/a. The biggest changes took place in Norway spruce and Pendula birch stands.During the early and late phases of stand development, the stands were C sources, since emissions from decaying litter and soil organic matter in the humus layer exceeded the growth of vegetation. Stands became C sources earlier under the changing climatic conditions than under the current conditions. In southern Finland, the long term average C storage was 107-201 Mg C/ha under the current climatic conditions, and 88-142 Mg C/ha under the changing conditions, depending on tree species.

To this aim, we conducted soil respiration measurements at 25 points in a 40Â mÂ xÂ 40Â m subplot of a 4Â ha study plot between 2002 and 2006, and examined the spatial variation in soil respiration averaged over the 4 years in relation to soil, root, and forest structural factors. In addition, we examined the spatial representativeness of soil respiration measured in the subplot using a specific scaling procedure. Consequently, we found significant positive correlation between the soil respiration and forest structural parameters such as the mean diameter at breast height (DBH), total basal area, and maximum DBH within 6Â m of the measurement points. The most important factor was the mean DBH within 6Â m of the measurement points, which had a significant linear relationship with soil respiration. Using the derived linear regression and an inventory dataset, we estimated the 4Â ha plot-scale soil respiration. The 4Â ha plot-scale estimation (6.0Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1) was nearly identical to the subplot-scale measurements (5.7Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1), which were roughly comparable to the nocturnal CO2 fluxes calculated using the eddy covariance technique. In addition, we discuss characteristics of the stand-scale soil respiration at this site by comparing with those of other forests reported in previous literature in terms of the soil C balance. Soil respiration at our site was noticeably greater, relative to the incident litterfall amount, than soil respiration in other tropical and temperate forests probably owing to the larger total belowground C allocation by emergent trees. Overall, this study suggests the arrangement of emergent trees with larger DBH and their belowground C allocation could be primary factors controlling spatial variations in soil respiration in the tropical rainforest.",

GPP (30.61Â MgCÂ ha-1Â year-1, eddy covariance measurements; 34.40Â MgCÂ ha-1Â year-1, biometric measurements) was comparable to those for Amazonian rainforests. ANPP (6.76 MgC ha-1Â year-1) was comparable to, and APR (8.01 MgC ha-1 year-1) was slightly lower than, their respective values for Amazonian rainforests, even though aboveground biomass was greater at our site. TBCF (19.63 MgC ha-1 year-1) was higher than those for Amazonian forests. The comparable ANPP and higher TBCF were unexpected, since higher water availability would suggest less fine root competition for water, giving higher ANPP and lower TBCF to GPP. Low nutrient availability may explain the comparable ANPP and higher TBCF. These data show that there are variations in C allocation patterns among mature tropical rainforests, and the variations cannot be explained solely by differences in soil water availability.",

The observations of ecosystem CO2 flux in this area are increasing both in duration and spatial density, but no synthesis has yet been conducted. We surveyed CO2 flux observation data obtained by eddy covariance methods at 49 sites in terrestrial Asia. The measurements at most sites (44 of 49) began after 2000. The net ecosystem uptake of CO2 (NEE) varied greatly among sites and years and averaged -132.6Â±73.7, -250.1Â±206.1, and -180.1Â±361.7 g C m-2 yr-1, in boreal, temperate, and tropical Asia, respectively, and the coefficient of variation among sites increased from boreal to tropical Asia. The site-averaged annual NEE was correlated linearly with the mean annual temperature (Tair) and also correlated logarithmically with the precipitation. Multiple regression analysis and stepwise analysis indicated that photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and Tair were the most significant predictors of the annual NEE. The study results suggest that Asian terrestrial ecosystems are currently significant net CO2 sinks and that the sink strength is largely controlled by temperature, moisture, and light conditions.

In addition, recent studies suggest that old-growth forests may be more significant carbon sinks than previously recognized. This has stimulated interest in quantifying aboveground carbon stocks in primary forest systems. We investigated the structural attributes and aboveground biomass in two remnant old-growth spruce-fir stands and compared these against a primary (never logged) mature reference stand. Our sites were located in the Gorgany Nature Reserve in western Ukraine. Overstory data were collected using variable radius plots; coarse woody debris was sampled along line intercept transects. Differences among sites were assessed using non-parametric statistical analyses. Goodness-of-fit tests were used to evaluate the form of diameter distributions. The results strongly supported the hypothesis that old-growth temperate spruce-fir forests have greater structural complexity compared to mature forests, including higher densities of large trees, more complex horizontal structure, and elevated aboveground biomass. The late-successional sites we sampled exhibited rotated sigmoid diameter distributions; these may reflect natural disturbance dynamics. Old-growth Carpathian spruce-fir forests store on average approximately 155-165 Mg ha-1 of carbon in aboveground tree parts alone. This is approximately 50% higher than mature stands. Given the scarcity of primary spruce-fir forests in the Carpathian region, remaining stands have high conservation value, both as habitat for late-successional species and as carbon storage reservoirs.

Aboveground biomass was estimated from allometric equations relating stem and branch diameters of individual trees to their biomass. Biomass production was calculated from annual increments in tree diameters and measurements of litterfall. Maintenance and construction respiration were calculated for each component using equations given by Ryan (1991a). Total belowground C flux was estimated from measurements of annual soil CO2 efflux less the C content of annual litterfall (assuming forest floor and soil C were at approximate steady state for the year that soil CO2 efflux was measured). The total C content of the standing biomass of the unfertilized stand was 138 t ha-1, with approximately 80% aboveground and 20% belowground. Forest floor C was 8.5 t ha-1. Soil C content (0-1 m) was 369 t ha-1 representing 70% of the total C pool in the ecosystem. Total gross annual C flux aboveground (biomass increment plus litterfall plus respiration) was 11.9 t ha-1 and gross flux belowground (coarse root increment plus fine root production plus root respiration) was 5.1 t ha-1. Total annual soil efflux was 7.1 t ha-1, of which 2.5 t ha-1 (35%) was contributed by litter decomposition.The short-term effect of changing the availability of P compared with C on allocation to aboveground versus belowground processes was estimated by comparing fertilized and unfertilized stands during the year after treatment. In the P-fertilized stand annual wood biomass increment increased by 30%, there was no evidence of change in canopy biomass, and belowground C allocation decreased by 19% relative to the unfertilized stand. Total annual C flux was 16.97 and 16.75 t ha-1 yr-1 and the ratio of below- to aboveground C allocation was 0.43 and 0.35 in the unfertilized and P-fertilized stands, respectively. Therefore, the major response of the forest stand to increased soil P availability appeared to be a shift in C allocation; with little change in total productivity. These results emphasise that both growth rate and allocation need to be estimated to predict changes in fluxes and storage of C in forests that may occur in response to disturbance or climate change.",

Fluxes were measured using micrometeorological methods and neural network analysis was used to fill gaps in the hourly flux time series. Productivity at Virginia Park is controlled by rainfall amount and timing during the wet season since this determines the leaf area index (Lai) of the C4 grass understorey which varies greatly compared to Lai of the trees. The savanna lost 99Â gÂ CÂ m-2 over the period July 2001-March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002-2003 wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510Â gÂ CÂ m-2 from February 2001 to March 2004, with annual productivity ranging from 1060Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in a normal year to 360Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 during the 2002-2003 drought which affected all of eastern Australia. Annual rainfall at the savanna was matched by annual evapotranspiration, indicating there was no surface runoff or deep drainage during our study. Trees at both sites were able to extract water deep within the soil profile to maintain annual transpiration above rainfall during the drought of 2002-2003.Measurements of Lai and gross primary production (PG) at the two sites were compared to estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data products. The MOD15 algorithm overestimated Lai by a factor of two at Tumbarumba but gave reasonable magnitudes and seasonal variation for the savanna. At Tumbarumba, MOD17 gave excellent estimates of the annual amplitude in PG but was less satisfactory in predicting the phase of the variations. MOD17 overestimated PG at Virginia Park during the dry season and the low-rainfall summer of 2002-2003 but gave satisfactory results during the other two wet seasons. Most of the variance in PG at both sites was explained by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Significantly improved predictions were obtained for the savanna by modifying the MOD17 algorithm to account for rainfall and potential evaporation in the antecedent 3 months, a surrogate for soil water availability.",

We propagated errors in sampling and those associated with allometric relations and other ratios used to estimate biomass of roots, lianas and epiphytes, and necromass. The major sources of uncertainty in our estimate were found in the allometric relations for trees with DBH greater than 35Â cm, in the estimates of biomass of trees with DBH less than 35Â cm, and in root biomass.

We measured the volume and density of fallen CWD at two sites, Cauaxi and Tapajos in the Eastern Amazon. At both sites we studied undisturbed forests (UFs) and logged forests 1 year after harvest. Conventional logging (CL) and reduced impact logging (RIL) were used for management on areas where the geometric volumes of logs harvested was about 25-30 m3 ha-1. Density for five classes of fallen CWD for large material (>10 cm diameter) ranged from 0.71 to 0.28 Mg m-3 depending upon the degree of decomposition. Density of wood within large fallen logs varied with position relative to the ground and with distance from the center of the log. Densities for materials with diameters from 2 to 5 and 5 to 10 cm were 0.36 and 0.45 Mg m-3, respectively. The average mass (Â±SE) of fallen CWD at Cauaxi was 55.2 (4.7), 74.7 (0.6), and 107.8 (10.5) Mg ha-1 for duplicate UF, RIL, and CL sites, respectively. At Tapajos, the average mass of fallen CWD was 50.7 (1.1) Mg ha-1 for UF and 76.2 (10.2) Mg ha-1 for RIL for duplicate sites compared with 282 Mg ha-1 for live aboveground biomass. Small- and medium-sized material (<10 cm dia.) accounted for 8-18% of the total fallen CWD mass. The large amount of fallen CWD at these UF sites relative to standing aboveground biomass suggests either that the forests have recently been subjected to a pulse of high mortality or that they normally suffer a high mortality rate in the range of 0.03 per year. Accounting for background CWD in UF, CL management produced 2.7 times as much CWD as RIL management. Excess CWD at logging sites would generate a substantial CO2 emission given the high rates of decay in moist tropical forests. ",

Both pastured sites showed similar annual soil respiration rates. Comparisons of the paired forests, one coniferous and the other broadleaf, only showed a significant difference over one annual cycle. Enhanced soil respiration in pastures may be the result of either enhanced root respiration and/or microbial respiration. Differences in pasture-forest soil respiration were primarily observed during the July through September summer period at all sites, suggesting that this is the critical period for observing and documenting differences. Evaluation of the soil microclimatic controls on soil respiration suggest that soil temperature exerts a major control on this process, and that examining these relationships on a seasonal rather than weekly basis provides the strongest relationships in poorly drained soils. Consistently greater pastured site Q 10s (2.52;2.42) than forested site Q 10s (2.27; 2.17) were observed, with paired-site differences of 0.25.",

Efforts to examine these vertically complex relationships in situ within soil profiles are lacking. In this study we examined how the climatic controls on CO2 production change within vertically distinct layers of the soil profile in intact and clearcut forest soils of a humid temperate forest system of Atlantic Canada. We measured mineral soil temperature (0, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm depth) and moisture (0-15 cm and 30-60 cm depth), along with CO2 surface efflux and subsurface concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 75 and 100 cm depth) in 1 m deep soil pits at 4 sites represented by two forest-clearcut pairs over a complete annual cycle. We examined relationships between surface efflux at each site, and soil heat, moisture, and mineral soil CO2 production. Following clearcut harvesting we observed increases in temperature through depth (1-2Â°C annually; often in excess of 4Â°C in summer and spring), alongside increases in soil moisture (30%). We observed a systematic breakdown in the expected exponential relationship between CO2 production and heat with mineral soil depth, consistent with an increase in the role moisture plays in constraining CO2 production. These findings should be considered in efforts to model and characterize mineral soil organic matter decomposition in harvested forest soils. ",

We monitored changes in above- and belowground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass allocation to the leaf component to determine the variation in carbon accumulation rate with forest age after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nine plots in a 4-year-old forest and fourteen plots in a 10-year-old forest were monitored for 5 and 7 years, respectively. Forest and plant part biomass were calculated from an allometric equation obtained from the same forest stands. Both above- and belowground biomass increased rapidly during the initial decade after abandonment. In contrast, a much slower rate of biomass accumulation was observed after the initial decade. LAI also increased by approximately double from the 4-year-old to 10-year-old forest, and then gently increased to the 17-year-old forest. We also found that allocation variation in leaf biomass and nitrogen was closely related to the rate of biomass accumulation as a forest aged. During the first decade after abandonment, a high biomass and nitrogen allocation to the leaf component may have allowed for a high rate of biomass accumulation. However, reduction in those allocations to leaf component after the initial decade may have helped to suppress the biomass accumulation rate in older secondary forests. Roots accounted for 14.0-16.1% of total biomass in the 4-17-year-old abandoned secondary forests. We also verified the model predicted values for belowground biomass by Cairns et al. (1997) and Mokany et al. (2006), although both models overestimated the values throughout our data sets by 45-50% in the 10-year-old forest. The low root:shoot ratio in the secondary forests may have caused this overestimation. Therefore, our results suggest that we should modify the models to estimate belowground biomass considering the low root:shoot ratio in tropical secondary forests.",

The ranges of Rs measured during the two study years were 0.5-6.9Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 for 2003-2004 (Year 1) and 0.4-6.8Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 for 2004-2005 (Year 2). Mean annual Rs for the stand was the same for both years, 2.7Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1. Temporal variability of Rs was controlled mainly by soil temperature (Ts), but soil moisture had a confounding effect on Ts. Annual estimates of total soil CO2 emissions at the site, calculated using a simple empirical Rs-Ts relationship, showed that Rs can account for about 88Â Â±Â 27% of total annual ecosystem respiration at the site. The majority of soil CO2 emissions came from the upper 12 to 20Â cm organic LFH (litter-fibric-humic) soil layer. The degree of spatial variability in Rs, along the measured transect, was seasonal and followed the seasonal trend of mean Rs: increasing through the growing season and converging to a minimum in winter (coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 4 to 74% in Year 1 and 4 to 62% in Year 2). Spatial variability in Rs was found to be negatively related to spatial variability in the C:N ratio of the LHF layer at the site. Spatial variability in Rs was also found to depend on forest tree species composition within the stand. Rs was about 15% higher in a broadleaf deciduous tree patch compared to evergreen coniferous area. However, the difference was not always significant (at 95% CI). In general, Rs in the mixedwood patch, having both deciduous and coniferous species, was dominated by broadleaf trees, reflecting changing physiological controls on Rs with seasons. Our results highlight the importance of discerning soil CO2 emissions at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. They also suggest including the LFH soil layer and allowing for seasonal variability in CO2 production within that layer, when modeling soil respiration in forest ecosystems.",

The data were used to estimate annual ecosystem respiration (Re) and its component fluxes, including soil, foliar, and woody tissue respiration; to investigate major environmental factors causing intersite and temporal variability in the observed fluxes; and to compare chamber-based Re estimates with eddy covariance-based estimates. While temperature was the dominant driving factor of temporal variability in component fluxes, intersite variability in CO2 emissions was attributed to differences in stand physiological characteristics, such as the presence of the LFH soil horizon, its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and the amount of canopy cover. Additional factors that contributed to flux variability included the frequency of precipitation events, vapor pressure deficit and stem diameter, depending on the component considered. Estimated annual chamber-based totals of Re across the four stands were 1526 Â± 137, 1278 Â± 137, 1985 Â± 293, and 773 Â± 46 g C m-2 yr-1 for the 67-, 32-, 17-, and 4-year-old stands, respectively. Soil respiration dominated emissions at the 4-year-old stand, while foliar respiration dominated emissions at the 17-year-old stand. In contrast, at the two oldest stands, soil and foliar respirations were comparable. Soil respiration accounted for 44%, 44%, 26%, and 70% of annual Re, across the 67-, 32-, 17-, and 4-year-old stands, while foliar respiration accounted for 48%, 41%, 60%, and 30% of annual Re, across the respective sites. Wood respiration was the smallest component of annual Re across the stands (8%, 15%, 14%, and 0.1%, respectively). The chamber-based Re values were higher than tower-based eddy covariance Re estimates, on average by 18%, 70%, 18%, and 36% at the 67-, 32-, 17-, and 4-year-old stands, respectively. This study contributes to our general understanding of the age-related effects and the role of climate on carbon emissions from various components of afforested ecosystems. Our results suggest that foliar respiration could be comparable to or higher than soil respiration in its contribution to Re in young to mature, planted or afforested, ecosystems. They also suggest that site quality and stand age are important factors to be considered in future studies of carbon dynamics of afforested stands. ",

In addition, meteorological parameters, litter fall and decomposition, plant species composition, and concentrations of NH4+/NO3- in the soil and N2O and CH4 in the soil atmosphere were measured. N2O emissions showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with highest rates in the wet season (108.6 Âµg N m-2 h-1) and significantly lower rates during dry season (mostly <10 Âµg N2O-N m-2 h-1). N2O emissions were positively correlated to N2O-concentrations in the soil profile and to moisture, but not to concentrations of NH4+ and NO3-. The annual emission of N2O (N = 6015) was 0.97 kg N ha-1 yr-1, and, thus, approximately 7 times lower than a previous estimate for the year 2000. The marked differences in N2O emissions between different years indicate that the interannual variability of N2O emissions from rain forest soils cannot be neglected. With regard to CH4 the soil functioned throughout the entire year as a significant sink. Rates of CH4 uptake during the dry period (35-68 Âµg CH4 m-2 h-1) were higher as compared to the wet period (4-45 Âµg CH4 m-2 h-1). A close linear correlation between soil moisture and magnitude of CH4 uptake was found. The calculated annual CH4 uptake (N = 6090) is 3.2 kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1. This implies that tropical rain forest soils function as significant sinks for atmospheric CH4 on a global scale. ",

We also conducted laboratory rewetting experiments with soil collected from the three sites using three different incubation temperatures (4Â Â°C, 10Â Â°C, and 20Â Â°C). Soil moisture (SM), soil organic matter (SOM), and total root mass values of the three sites were significantly different from one another; however, soil temperature (ST), observed soil CO2 efflux and sensitivity of soil CO2 efflux to ST (i.e., Q10Â =Â 3.7Â Â±Â 0.1) were not significantly different among the three sites. Soil temperature was a dominant control factor regulating soil CO2 efflux during most of the year. We infer that soil CO2 efflux was not significantly different among the sites due to similar ST and Q10. Though a significant increase in soil CO2 efflux following rewetting of dry soil was observed both in the field observations (60-170%) and laboratory incubation experiments (100-1000%), both the increased rates of soil CO2 efflux and the magnitude of change in SM were not significantly different among the sites. The increased rates of soil CO2 efflux following rewetting depended on the initial SM before rewetting. During drying phase after rewetting, a significant correlation between SM and soil CO2 efflux was found, but the effect of ST on increased soil CO2 efflux was not clear. Cumulative peak soil CO2 efflux (11.3Â Â±Â 0.7Â gÂ CO2Â m-2) following rewetting in the field was not significantly different among the sites. Those evidences indicate that the observed similar rewetting effects on soil CO2 efflux can be explained by the similar magnitude of change in SM after rewetting at the sites. We conclude that regardless of vegetation type, soil CO2 efflux and the effect of rewetting on soil CO2 efflux do not differ among the sites, and ST is a primary control factor for soil CO2 efflux while SM modulates the effect of rewetting on soil CO2 efflux. Further studies are needed to quantify and incorporate relationship of initial dryness of the soil and the frequency of the dry-wet cycle on soil CO2 efflux into models describing carbon (C) processes in forested ecosystems.",

This indicates that winter CO2 efflux contributed 24% of the annual CO2 efflux over the period of measurement. In tundra and boreal biomes, tussock is an important source of carbon efflux to the atmosphere, and contributes 3.4 times more than other vegetation types. To ensure that representativeness of soil CO2 efflux was determined, 36 sample points were used at each site during the growing season, so that the experimental mean fell within Â±20% of the full sample mean at 80% and 90% confidence levels. We found that soil CO2 efflux was directly proportional to the seasonal mean soil temperature, but inversely proportional to the seasonal mean soil moisture level, rather than to the elevation-corrected July air temperature. This suggests that the seasonal mean soil temperature is the dominant control on the latitudinal distribution of soil CO2 efflux in the high-latitude ecosystems of Alaska.",

Forest soils contain the largest and longest lived carbon pools in terrestrial ecosystems and are therefore extremely important to the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon and future climate. Soil respiration is a sensitive integrator of many soil processes that control carbon storage in soil, and is therefore a good metric of changes to soil carbon cycling. Here, we summarize soil respiration data from four forest free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments in developing and established forests that have been exposed to elevated atmospheric [CO2] (168 ÂµL L-1 average enrichment) for 2-6 years. The sites have similar experimental design and use similar methodology (closed-path infrared gas analyzers) to measure soil respiration, but differ in species composition of the respective forest communities. We found that elevated atmospheric [CO2] stimulated soil respiration at all sites, and this response persisted for up to 6 years. Young developing stands experienced greater stimulation than did more established stands, increasing 39% and 16%, respectively, averaged over all years and communities. Further, at sites that had more than one community, we found that species composition of the dominant trees was a major controller of the absolute soil CO2 efflux and the degree of stimulation from CO2 enrichment. Interestingly, we found that the temperature sensitivity of bulk soil respiration appeared to be unaffected by elevated atmospheric CO2. These findings suggest that stage of stand development and species composition should be explicitly accounted for when extrapolating results from elevated CO2 experiments or modeling forest and global carbon cycles.

Our understanding of the controls on C allocation to coarse-root growth is rudimentary, but it has important implications for projecting belowground net primary production responses to global change. Age-related changes in C allocation to coarse roots represent a critical uncertainty for modeling landscape-scale C storage and cycling. We used a 55 year chronosequence approach with complete above- and below-ground harvests to assess the effects of stand development on biomass partitioning in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), a commercially important pine species. Averaged within site, individual-tree root/shoot ratios were dynamic across stand development, changing from 0.17 at 2-, 3-, and 5-year-old sites, to 0.80 at the 8-year-old site, to 0.29 at the 55-year-old site. The results of our study suggest that a current research challenge is to determine the generality of patterns of root-shoot biomass partitioning through stand development for both coniferous and hardwood forest types, and to document how these patterns change as a function of stand age, tree size, environment, and management.",

We predicted that the magnitude of altitudinal changes in ANPP would be less on ultrabasic than on sedimentary substrates, reflecting lower temperature dependency of ANPP under stronger P limitation. 3 Although ANPP declined with increasing altitude on both substrates, the slopes of the two regression lines were similar. The intercept was, however, marginally greater on sedimentary than on ultrabasic substrate. 4 Stand-level nutrient-use efficiencies (the ratio of litterfall mass to nutrient return) for N and P were only affected by altitude on ultrabasic substrate where they increased exponentially. Mean foliar N and P contents per unit leaf area of the canopy species increased with altitude on both substrates, but differed between substrates at the same altitude only for P (lower on ultrabasic). 5 Leaf area index (LAI) decreased upslope on both substrates. We assumed that half of primary production was allocated below-ground in order to evaluate stand level net assimilation rate (NAR). This was nearly constant on sedimentary substrate, but declined linearly with increasing altitude on ultrabasic substrate, where it may have to be added to LAI to explain ANPP patterns. 6 We suggest that on sedimentary substrate trees may be able to maintain NAR under colder environments by increasing foliar N and P per unit leaf area, but P deficiency prevents them from adjusting on ultrabasic substrate.

During the 1st drought year, ecosystem respiration (R) was reduced at the aspen site due to the drying of surface soil layers. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) increased as a result of a warm spring and a slow decrease of deep soil moisture. These conditions resulted in the highest annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the 9 years of flux measurements at this site. During 2002 and 2003, a reduction of 6% and 34% in NEP, respectively, compared to 2000 was observed as the result of reductions in both R and GEP, indicating a conservative response to the drought. Although the drought affected most of western Canada, there was considerable spatial variability in summer rainfall over the 100-km extent of the study area; summer rainfalls in 2001 and 2002 at the two conifer sites minimized the impact of the drought. In 2003, however, precipitation was similarly low at all three sites. Due to low topographic position and consequent poor drainage at the black spruce site and the coarse soil with low water-holding capacity at the jack pine site almost no reduction in R, GEP, and NEP was observed at these two sites. This study shows that the impact of drought on carbon sequestration by boreal forest ecosystems strongly depends on rainfall distribution, soil characteristics, topography, and the presence of vegetation that is well adapted to these conditions.",

However, little experimental evidence for this hypothesis exists so far for forests at the ecosystem level. Therefore, we performed continuous eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide over an unmanaged beech forest in the Hainich National Park in Central Germany as part of the EU project CARBOEUROFLUX. This forest shows typical characteristics of an â€˜advanced' forest with large dead wood pools, a diverse stand structure and a wide tree age class distribution, up to 250 years. This forest was a large carbon sink over 2 years, with 494Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year in 2000 and 490Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year in 2001. Daytime summer fluxes were strongly controlled by photosynthetic photon flux density (R2=0.7-0.9), with minor effects of the ratio of diffuse to total downward radiation or the vapor pressure deficit. Nighttime CO2 fluxes were mainly controlled by soil temperature (R2=0.8) and soil moisture. In addition, high nighttime CO2 fluxes (4-6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1) were found directly before and during bud break in spring as well as just after leaf fall of both years (2000 and 2001), reflecting stand physiology corresponding to phenological changes, independent of soil temperature. Additional wind profile measurements at five heights within the canopy revealed a decoupling of above and below canopy air flow under conditions of low friction velocity (u*<0.4Â mÂ s-1), probably indicating down slope drainage. In conclusion, unmanaged forests at a comparatively late stage of successional development can still act as significant carbon sinks with large implications for forest management practice and negotiations about biological sinks within the Kyoto Protocol.",

However, the choice of experimental design strongly affects estimates of annual respiration and of the contribution of soil respiration to total ecosystem respiration. In a detailed study of ecosystem and soil respiration fluxes in an old unmanaged deciduous forest in Central Germany over 3Â years (2000-2002), we combined soil chamber and eddy covariance measurements to obtain a comprehensive picture of respiration in this forest. The closed portable chambers offered to investigate spatial variability of soil respiration and its controls while the eddy covariance system offered continuous measurements of ecosystem respiration. Over the year, both fluxes were mainly correlated with temperature. However, when soil moisture sank below 23Â vol.% in the upper 6Â cm, water limitations also became apparent. The temporal resolution of the eddy covariance system revealed that relatively high respiration rates occurred during budbreak due to increased metabolic activity and after leaf fall because of increased decomposition. Spatial variability in soil respiration rates was large and correlated with fine root biomass (r 2 = 0.56) resulting in estimates of annual efflux varying across plots from 730 to 1,258 (mean 898) g C m-2 year-1. Power function calculations showed that achieving a precision in the soil respiration estimate of 20% of the full population mean at a confidence level of 95%, requires about eight sampling locations. Our results can be used as guidelines to improve the representativeness of soil respiration measurements by nested sampling designs, being applied in long-term and large-scale carbon sequestration projects such as FLUXNET and CarboEurope.",

The 4-year-old clearcut was a source of carbon throughout the year combining a low gross primary productivity (GPP) with a total ecosystem respiration (TER) similar to the forest stands. The annual NEE of the clearcut, measured by EC, was 386 g C m-2. Tree growth was negligible and the estimated NEP was -262 g C m-2 a-1. The annual GPPs at the other sites were close to each other (928-1072 g C m-2 a-1), but TER differed markedly, being greatest at the 12-year-old site (905 g C m-2 a-1) and smallest in the 75-year-old stand (616 g C m-2 a-1). Measurements of soil CO2 efflux showed that different rates of soil respiration largely explained the differences in TER. The NEE and NEP of the 12-year-old stand were close to zero. The forested stands were sinks of carbon. They had similar annual patterns of carbon exchange and half-hourly eddy fluxes were highly correlated, indicating similar responses to the environment. The NEE in the 40-year-old stand varied between -179 and -192 g C m-2 a-1, while NEP was between 214 and 242 g C m-2 a-1. The annual NEE of the 75-year-old stand was 323 g C m-2 and NEP was 252 g C m-2. This indicates that there was no reduction in carbon sink strength with stand age. ",

And compared these estimates with estimates based on biometric data using a warm-temperate deciduous and evergreen mixed forest in Japan. Biometric approaches were based on analyses of autotrophic carbon pools and heterotrophic carbon fluxes (NEP) versus changes in two major carbon pools (<U+0394>C). To estimate <U+0394>C, we calculated contributions to the soil carbon pool by litter and coarse woody debris (CWD) independently. The 3-year mean annual NEE from 2000 to 2002 was -1.23Â MgCÂ ha-1Â year-1 (a negative flux indicates carbon gain). Estimated <U+0394>C and NEP were 1.73 and 0.91Â MgCÂ m-2Â year-1, respectively (a positive flux indicates carbon gain). The increment of live biomass contributed 76% of total <U+0394>C. Estimated NEP varied widely due to large spatial variation in soil respiration. A realistic u* threshold was 0.4Â mÂ s-1. The estimated NEE value was larger than NEP. The change in NEE as a function of the u* threshold was marked, and most of the measured data (about 80%) could be eliminated by using the 0.4Â mÂ s-1u* threshold. These results seem to be caused by the loss of most nocturnal respiration as a result of horizontal advection or drainage flow (because the study site was located on complex terrain). This tendency was consistent for towers located on a ridge and in a valley.",

Both RE and RS had seasonal hysteresis and were higher in spring than at the same temperature during autumn. Under warm and humid conditions, the rate of decomposition of newly supplied leaf litter in one year was high (60% loss). Consequently, RLL and RH were higher in spring after leaf drop, when more fresh material was available, than in autumn. In this study, 42 and 88% of the difference in RE and RS between spring and autumn (soil temperature 16-18Â°C) could be accounted for by the difference in RH, respectively, and 71% of the difference in RH could be accounted for by the difference in RLL. This study showed that seasonal changes in heterotrophic respiration (RLL and RH) could be a major factor in the seasonal hysteresis of RE and RS.",

Net ecosystem production (NEP) was estimated after correcting for night-time efflux by using chamber observations of soil and leaf respiration and for day-time CO2 flux by using the light-response curve. Peak CO2 uptake occurred during early summer and autumn; a summer depression and winter uptake were also characteristic of this forest. The estimated NEP showed differences among the years, depending on drought and radiation conditions. The mid-day average of surface conductance was fluctuated between 5 and 10Â mmÂ s-1 during normal years and sometimes decreasing in dry summers. In the wet summer, it increased up to 20Â mmÂ s-1. During the severe and long-term drought, the surface conductance was clearly depressed, suggesting that the surface conductance was strongly influenced by drought. The canopy maximum carboxylation rate (big-leaf VCMAX) was derived from 30Â min fluxes using the same inversion procedure as used in leaf-level analysis. VCMAX at the normal period was generally explained with one temperature-dependence curve (VCMAX25: 58.4Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, <U+0394>Ha: 32,200Â JÂ mol-1) at this warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forest. The decline of the normalised VCMAX (VCMAX25) was detected during the severe drought and the expanding period. VCMAX25 did not recover after rain during winter of the year of the severe drought, which suggests that leaf function had suffered severe damage.",

The comparison of Fc, NEE and soil respiration strongly suggests that nighttime CO2 efflux was underestimated even when the CO2 storage term is considered. The correction of Fc data for low u* did not correct this underestimate, and it was strongly suggested that this forest was not a strong carbon sink, as raw Fc data, even with the u* filtering, implied. Monthly average daytime diurnal changes in CO2 exchange over the canopy were fairly constant from 2003 to 2005 despite fluctuations in soil moisture, solar radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit between dry and wet periods. An obvious inhibition of canopy CO2 exchange in the afternoon coupling with increases in VPD and air temperature was observed year-round. In the case of nighttime NEE, a slight increase in wet period was observed. Diurnal pattern of CO2 exchange revealed that obvious restriction of canopy photosynthesis in the afternoon was occurred in this forest irrespective of soil moisture. Seasonal and annual patterns of CO2 exchange reveal that one of the main causes which induce the difference in NEE pattern between Amazonian and Southeast Asian rainforests was not the difference in daytime photosynthesis but the difference in ecosystem respiration related with dry and rainy seasons. The decrease of CO2 uptake (increase of NEE) at wet period was also observed at this site, but did not form an obvious seasonality such as in Amazonian forests.",

Turbulent fluxes from the closed-path system are computed via different methodologies, including those recommended from EUROFLUX (Adv. Ecol. Res. 30 (2000) 113; Agric. Forest Meteorol. 107 (2001a, b) 43 and 71), and sensitivity analysis demonstrates the merit of post-processing for accurate flux calculation. Footprint modeling, energy balance closure, and empirical modeling corroborate the eddy flux measurements, indicating best reliability in the daytime. The ecosystem, a net source of atmospheric CO2, is capable of fixing carbon during fair weather during any season due to the abundance of re-growing species (mostly grass), formerly from the understorey. Annual carbon loss of 200-340 g m-2 depends on the period chosen, with inter-annual variability evident during the 18-month measurement period and apparently related to available light. Empirical models, with weekly photosynthetic parameters corresponding to seasonal vegetation and respiration depending on soil temperature, fit the data well and allow partitioning of annual NEE into GPP and TER components. Comparison with a similar nearby mature forest (Agric. Forest Meteorol. 108 (2001) 183) indicates that clear-cutting reduces GPP by two thirds but TER by only one third, transforming a strong forest sink into a source of CO2. Likewise, the loss of 50% of evapotranspiration (by the trees) leads to increased temperatures and thus reduced net radiation (by one third), and a 50% increase in sensible heat loss by the clear cut.

Three of the comparisons represented high coniferous forestry (spruce in Britain, and pines in Finland and France), while a coppice-with-standard oak plantation was examined in Italy. While every comparison revealed that harvesting converted a mature forest carbon sink into a carbon source of similar magnitude, the mechanisms by which this occurred were very different according to species or management practice. In Britain, Finland, and France the annual sink (source) strength for mature (clear-cut) stands was estimated at 496 (112), 138 (239), and 222 (225) g C m-2, respectively, with 381 (427) g C m-2 for the mature (coppiced) stand in Italy. In all three cases of high forestry in Britain, Finland, and France, clear-cutting crippled the photosynthetic capacity of the ecosystem - with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1970 (988), 1010 (363), and 1600 (602) g C m-2- and also reduced ecosystem respiration to a lesser degree - TER of 1385 (1100), 839 (603), and 1415 (878) g C m-2, respectively. By contrast, harvesting of the coppice oak system provoked a burst in respiration - with mature (clear-cut) TER estimated at 1160 (2220) gC m-2- which endured for the 3 years sampled postharvest. The harvest disturbance also reduced GPP in the coppice system - with mature (clear-cut) GPP of 1600 (1420) g C m-2- but to a lesser extent than in the coniferous forests, and with near-complete recovery within a few years. Understanding the effects of harvest on the carbon balance of European forest systems is a necessary step towards characterizing carbon exchange for timberlands on large scales. ",

The forest was a moderate carbon (C) sink over its entire 11-year data record (FNEPÂ =Â 153Â Â±Â 99Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), including the peak drought years of 2002 and 2003. In 2001, the depletion of water near the soil surface likely reduced heterotrophic soil respiration while water remaining deep in the root zone maintained P above the pre-drought mean, resulting in above-average FNEP. In 2002 and 2003, the forest remained a C sink even though P was below average because R was also below average-a likely consequence of the influence of low soil water content in deep and shallow soil layers on both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. In 2004, the recharge of soil water in shallow soil layers allowed R to recover to its pre-drought values, whereas low spring temperatures, the slow recharge of soil water in deep soil layers in spring, late leaf emergence and diminished leaf area index combined to suppress P and produce the lowest annual FNEP of the 11-year record (4Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1). The low FNEP and P were mirrored in the lowest stem growth and LAI values of the 11-year record. In 2005, a warm wet year, both the annual values and seasonal variations of FNEP, P and R returned to those of pre-drought years; the partial recovery of LAI to pre-drought values suggests that aspen P was able to adjust to this restriction on C assimilation. Growing season average dry surface conductance (gsv), the Priestley-Taylor coefficient (a) and light use efficiency (LUE) reached their lowest values in 2003 and became similar to pre-drought years in 2004-2005. Water use efficiency (WUE) was highest in 2003 and remained above average in 2004 and 2005. At the ecosystem scale, the above-average gains made in C sequestration in the first year of the drought were significantly offset by below-average stand FNEP in the final 2 years of the drought, and in the year following the drought.",

During 2000-2006, which included a three-year drought, the forest was a weak sink for CO2 with annual FNEP ranging from 27 to 80 g C m-2 (56 Â± 21 g C m-2 a-1). The beginning of the growing season occurred when daily mean air temperature exceeded 4Â°C and the near surface soil temperature equaled or exceeded 0Â°C. The length of the growing season varied from 186 to 232 days. During the extreme drought year (2003), the smaller reduction in annual Pg than in Re resulted in highest FNEP of the record. Annual FNEP decreased slightly with increasing soil water content; however, there was evidence of increased FNEP due to high water table conditions in 2004 because of the slightly higher decrease in Re than Pg. Although bulk surface conductance (gs) decreased significantly during the dry conditions in 2003, the associated increase in D prevented a significant drop in E, which resulted in only a slight decline in evaporative fraction and almost no change in water use efficiency. Interannual variation inPg, Re and FNEP in the early growing season (April-June) and late growing season (July-September) was controlled by air temperature and soil water content, respectively. However, spring (April-May) mean air temperature was the main factor determining the interannual variation in annual FNEP. The effect of late growing season soil water content on annual Pg and Re was greater than its effect on annual FNEP. The results emphasize the need to consider soil moisture conditions as well as temperature when simulating the response of the carbon balance components of this ecosystems to climate change. ",

During the 9-year period, 1998-2006, which included a strong El Nino/La Nina event, the near-end-of-rotation stand (DF49, 57 years old in 2006) was a moderate carbon (C) sink for CO2 with annual FNEP ranging from 267 to 410 g C m-2 yr-1 (mean Â± SD, 357 Â± 51 g C m-2 yr-1). The pole/sapling stand (HDF88, 18 years old in 2006) was a weak C source (FNEP = -64 Â± 75 g C m-2 yr-1), and the recently harvested stand (HDF00, 6 years old in 2006) was a large C source (FNEP = -515 Â± 88 g C m-2 yr-1) during 2002-2006. Irrespective of stand age, all sites responded quite similarly to changes in environmental variables during each year. Daily total values of Pg and Re were highest in July-August in all three stands, while daily FNEP peaked during April-June at DF49, May-June at HDF88, and June-July at HDF00. Reductions in root-zone soil water content decreased both Pg and Re especially during the dry period from May to September, and this effect was more pronounced in the younger stands. Evapotranspiration and dry-foliage surface conductance also decreased with decreasing root-zone soil water content whereas water use efficiency appeared to be conservative, especially at DF49. Increasing spring temperature had a positive effect on annual Pg and Re but caused a slight decrease in annual FNEP. During the summer to autumn transition period, increases in soil water content resulted in a greater increase in Re than Pg causing a reduction in FNEP. The interannual variation in the C balance was determined mainly by the interannual variation in Re for the near-end-of-rotation stand and Pg for the two younger stands. The results indicate that regardless of the stand age, interannual variability in the C balance was mainly determined by year-to-year variability in spring temperature and water availability in late summer.

Litter fall followed a monomodal distribution pattern with a distinct peak during the dry period from November-December to March-April.Dillenia pentagyna, Grewia tiliaefolia, Macrosolen spp.,Xylia xylocarpa, Terminalia spp.,Lagerstroemia lanceolata, Cleistanthus collinus, Bridelia retusa, andHelicteres isora were the principal litter producing species at these sites. The annual litter fall ranged from 12.18 to 14.43 t ha-1. Structural attributes of vegetation such as floristic composition, basal area, density and disturbance intensity did not directly influence litter fall rates.Leaf litter decay rates for six dominant tree species were assessed following the standard litter bag technique. One hundred and eight litter bags per species containing 20 g samples were installed in the forest floor litter layer at the same three sites selected for the litter fall quantification exercise. The residual litter mass decreased linearly with time for all species. In general, less disturbed sites and species adapted to higher nitrogen availabilities exhibited relatively higher decay rate coefficients (k). The rapid organic matter turnover observed in comparison with published temperate forest litter decay rates confirms that tropical moist deciduous forest species are characterised by faster decomposition rates.Mean concentrations of N, P and K in the litter were profoundly variable amongst the dominant species. Initial nitrogen content of the leaf litter varied from 0.65 to 1.6%, phosphorus from 0.034 to 0.077% and potassium from 0.25 to 0.62%.C. collinus, an understorey shrub consistently recorded the lowest litter concentrations for all nutrients. The overriding pattern is one of higher nutrient levels in the overstorey leaf litter and lower concentrations in the understorey litter. Furthermore, as decomposition proceeded, the nitrogen concentration of the residual biomass increased.",

This forest has been managed following a concept of nature-oriented forestry since the 1980s. One of the goals of the study was to test whether changed management led to increased carbon sequestration. The forest contains several broadleaved tree species. Depending on wind direction, the fetch-area of the eddy-covariance data was dominated by different tree species. Three subplots dominated by Oak, Beech or Alder/Ash could be distinguished from the tower data. In each of these subplots, 30 x 30 m2 areas were defined to analyse leaf area index, litterfall and the increase of the wood biomass. Eddy-covariance analysis showed that the gross primary productivity (GPP') was higher in the Oak subplot (-1794 g C m-2 yr-1) in comparison with the Beech plot and the Alder/Ash plot (-1470 and -1595 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively). The total ecosystem respiration (TER) was the highest in the Alder/Ash-dominated subplot (1401 g  C m-2 yr-1) followed by the Oak plot and the Beech plot (1235 and 1174 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively). The resulting net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was -559 g C m-2 yr-1 for the Oak-dominated subplot, -295 g C m-2 yr-1 for the Beech plot and -193 g C m-2 yr-1 for the Alder/Ash plot. From Stand survey and modelling, the net primary productivity was estimated as 1103, 702 and 671 g C m-2 yr-1 in the Oak, Beech and Alder/Ash plot, respectively. Also carbon flux with litterfall was the highest in the Oak plot 343 g C m-2 yr-1 and lowest in Alder/Ash plot (197 g m-2 yr-1) with the Beech plot in between (228 g m-2 yr-1). The observations indicate an increase of the proportion of litterfall with increasing GPP' and a different ability of carbon sequestration of the three stands in medium temporary scale. Only in the Oak stand that comprised the oldest trees and the most structured canopy the carbon sequestration was increased compared with conventionally managed forests. ",

A root and mycorrhiza exclosure experiment in the field separated auto- and heterotrophic soil respiration. It was compared to modeled heterotrophic respiration resulting from two different approaches: a modular component model of soil respiration calculated autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration with litter, climate and canopy photosynthesis as input variables. It was calibrated by independent soil respiration measurements in the field. A second model was calibrated by incubation of soil samples from different soil layers in the laboratory. In this case, the annual sum of Rh was calculated by an empirical model including response curves to temperature and a soil moisture. The three approaches showed good accordance during spring and summer and when the annual sums of Rh calculated by the two models were compared. Average Rh for the years 2002-2006 were 436Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 (field model) and 417Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 (lab-model), respectively. Differences between the approaches revealed specific limitations of each method. The average carbon balance of the Hainich forest soil was estimated to be between 1 and 35Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 depending on the model used and the averaging period. A comparison with nighttime data from eddy covariance (EC) showed that EC data were lower than modelled soil respiration in many situations.

In this paper, we examined CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method from 2004 to 2008 in two major ecosystems in the KoFlux sites in Korea, i.e., the Gwangneung Deciduous forest (GDK) and the Haenam Farmland (HFK). Our objectives were to identify the repeatability of the mid-season depression of NEE encountered at the two sites based on the single-year observation, and to further scrutinize its cause, effect, and interannual variability by using multi-year observations. In both GDK and HFK sites, the mid-season depression of NEE was reproduced each year but with different timing, magnitude, and mechanism. At the GDK site, a predominant factor causing the mid-season depression was a decreased solar radiation and the consequent reduction in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) during the summer monsoon period. At the HFK site, however, the monsoonal effect was less pronounced and the apparent mid-season depression was mainly a result of the management practices such as cultivation of spring barley and rice transplantation. Other flux observation sites in East Asia also showed a decline in radiation but with a lesser degree during the monsoon season, resulting in less pronounced depression in NEE. In our study, the observed depressions in NEE caused both GDK and HFK sites to become a weaker carbon sink or even a source in the middle of the growing season. On average, the GDK site (with maximum leaf area index of ~5) was a weak carbon sink with NEE of -84 gC m-2 y-1. Despite about 20% larger GPP (of 1321 gC m-2y-1) in comparison with the GDK site, the HFK site (with maximum leaf area index of 3-4) was a weaker carbon sink with NEE of -58 gC m-2 y-1 because of greater ecosystem respiration (of 1263 gC m-2 y-1). These NEE values were near the low end of the ranges reported in the literature for similar ecosystems in mid-latitudes. With the projected trends of the extended length of monsoon with more intensive rainfalls in East Asia, the observed delicate coupling between carbon and hydrological cycles may turn these key ecosystems into carbon neutral.

Due to very low soil fertility in this part of Congo, getting maximum sustainable production is fundamental. The aim of this work was to obtain quantitative data on the biogeochemical functioning of an Eucalyptus ecosystem and to provide relevant information to forest managers. The dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation presented herein concerns an important flow in the nutrient cycle. It has been studied using a chronosequence approach for a single clone. Twelve trees were sampled in each of the five stands at ages 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 (logging age). For the root system, three trees were studied in each of the 1-, 4- and 7-year-old stands. Tables were established to predict biomass and nutrient content from DBH and ages of the trees. They were applied to the inventory of the different stands to evaluate biomass and nutrient content for each component.The results exhibit different dynamics of biomass and nutrient accumulation:- P and Ca accumulation is proportional to biomass of the trees throughout rotation;- Mg is mainly accumulated during the first and the second year of the rotation, in connection with crown establishment;- N and K are characterized by an intermediary dynamics, 50% of N and 65% of K have already been accumulated by the time the trees are two years old. The models were validated using 18 other trees sampled in the seven-year-old stand of the chronosequence. Nutrient removal by harvesting was also evaluated for different logging scenarios. The results confirm the need to de-bark on-site. This technique reduces the removal of Ca and Mg by >50%. The quantities exported with pulpwood and firewood are ca. 100Â kg N, 30Â kg P, 39Â kg K, 33Â kg Ca and 19Â kg Mg per hectare.",

Stand-specific soil respiration-temperature models were developed to estimate annual soil CO2 efflux. Soil temperature was the main factor explaining RS and its components, followed by labile and total SOC. These three variables were significantly affected by forest composition, while no difference in soil moisture, distance to the nearest tree and root content was observed between stand types. A reciprocal forest floor transplant experiment showed that the influence of stand types on mineral soil temperature was due to a difference in light penetration rather than forest floor characteristics. Annual RS and RH were significantly greater in MW and TA than in BS, whereas annual RA was greater in BS and MW than in TA. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) of both RS and RH was significantly higher in BS than in MW and TA, suggesting that CO2 efflux from BS soils could be increased more under climate warming than that from the other stand types. Our results show evidence that boreal forest composition affects soil CO2 efflux and that litter quality is not the only factor explaining the differences between stand types. The influence of forest composition on soil CO2 efflux would be mediated through effects on soil temperature as well as on factors affecting the accumulation and the quality of SOC.",

There was a seasonal trend in <U+025B> with a relatively constant level of approximately 0.90 g C MJ-1 from April to September Daily NPP did not increase for daily intercepted radiation above 6 MJ m-2 d-1, indicating that between-years variation in NPP is not directly dependent on total Qi.

This work aims to i) detect the effect of elevated CO2 on soil respiration during the second rotation of a short rotation forest, at two levels of N availability; and ii) identify the main drivers behind any changes in soil respiration.MethodsA poplar plantation (POP-EUROFACE) was grown for two rotations of 3Â years under elevated CO2 maintained by a FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) technique. Root biomass, litter production and soil respiration were followed for two consecutive years after coppice.ResultsIn the plantation, the stimulation of fine root and litter production under elevated CO2 observed at the beginning of the rotation declined over time. Soil respiration (SR) was continuously stimulated by elevated CO2, with a much larger enhancement during the growing (up to 111Â %) than in the dormant season (40Â %). The SR increase at first appeared to be due to the increase in fine root biomass, but at the end of the 2nd rotation was supported by litter decomposition and the availability of labile C. Soil respiration increase under elevated CO2 was not affected by N availability.ConclusionsThe stimulation of SR by elevated CO2 was sustained by the decomposition of above and belowground litter and by the greater availability of easily decomposable substrates into the soil. In the final year as elevated CO2 did not increase C allocation to roots, the higher SR suggests greater C losses from the soil, thus reducing the potential for C accumulation.",

Inverse Lagrangian dispersion analysis provides a promising approach to addressing such a problem when measured mean CO2 concentration profiles and nocturnal velocity statistics are available. An inverse method, termed â€˜Constrained Source Optimization' or CSO, which couples a localized near-field theory (LNF) of turbulent dispersion to respiratory sources, is developed to estimate seasonal and annual components of ecosystem respiration. A key advantage to the proposed method is that the effects of variable leaf area density on flow statistics are explicitly resolved via higher-order closure principles. In CSO, the source distribution was computed after optimizing key physiological parameters to recover the measured mean concentration profile in a least-square fashion. The proposed method was field-tested using 1 year of 30-min mean CO2 concentration and CO2 flux measurements collected within a 17-year-old (in 1999) even-aged loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in central North Carolina. Eddy-covariance flux measurements conditioned on large friction velocity, leaf-level porometry and forest-floor respiration chamber measurements were used to assess the performance of the CSO model. The CSO approach produced reasonable estimates of ecosystem respiration, which permits estimation of ecosystem gross primary production when combined with daytime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements. We employed the CSO approach in modelling annual respiration of above-ground plant components (c. 214 g C m-2 year-1) and forest floor (c. 989 g C m-2 year-1) for estimating gross primary production (c. 1800 g C m-2 year-1) with a NEE of c. 605 g C m-2 year-1 for this pine forest ecosystem. We conclude that the CSO approach can utilise routine CO2 concentration profile measurements to corroborate forest carbon balance estimates from eddy-covariance NEE and chamber-based component flux measurements.

Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, it is unclear how small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (-32.1Â±8.4 mm yr-1 compared with surface elevation changes of +4.2Â±1.4 mm yr-1 in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO2 and CH4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25.3Â±7.4 tCO2 ha-1 yr-1 (using surface carbon efflux) and 35.6Â±76.9 tCO2 ha-1 yr-1 (using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between extracting mangrove wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage.

For understanding the mechanistic responses of ecosystem processes to environmental change it is important to separate these two flux components. Two approaches are conventionally used: (1) respiration measurements made at night are extrapolated to the daytime or (2) light-response curves are fit to daytime NEE measurements and respiration is estimated from the intercept of the ordinate, which avoids the use of potentially problematic nighttime data. We demonstrate that this approach is subject to biases if the effect of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) modifying the light response is not included. We introduce an algorithm for NEE partitioning that uses a hyperbolic light response curve fit to daytime NEE, modified to account for the temperature sensitivity of respiration and the VPD limitation of photosynthesis. Including the VPD dependency strongly improved the model's ability to reproduce the asymmetric diurnal cycle during periods with high VPD, and enhances the reliability of Reco estimates given that the reduction of GPP by VPD may be otherwise incorrectly attributed to higher Reco. Results from this improved algorithm are compared against estimates based on the conventional nighttime approach. The comparison demonstrates that the uncertainty arising from systematic errors dominates the overall uncertainty of annual sums (median absolute deviation of GPP: 47 g C m-2 yr-1), while errors arising from the random error (median absolute deviation: ~2 g C m-2 yr-1) are negligible. Despite site-specific differences between the methods, overall patterns remain robust, adding confidence to statistical studies based on the FLUXNET database. In particular, we show that the strong correlation between GPP and Reco is not spurious but holds true when quasi-independent, i.e. daytime and nighttime based estimates are compared. ",

If so, what environmental drivers might potentially be responsible? Location: Central Amazonia, north of Manaus, Brazil. Methods: Within 20 1-ha plots scattered over ~300 km2, all trees (=10 cm diameter at breast height) were marked, identified, and measured five times between 1981 and 2003. We estimated stand-level dynamics (mortality, recruitment, and growth) for each census interval and evaluated weather parameters over the study period. Results: We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality across our plots. Tree recruitment also rose significantly over time but lagged behind mortality. Tree growth generally accelerated but varied considerably among census intervals, and was lowest when mortality was highest. Tree basal area rose 4% overall, but stem number exhibited no clear trend. In terms of climate variation, annual maximum and minimum temperatures increased significantly during our study. Rainfall anomalies were strongly and positively associated with ENSO events. Conclusions: The increasing forest dynamics, growth, and basal area observed are broadly consistent with the CO2 fertilization hypothesis. However, pronounced shorter-term variability in stand dynamics might be associated with climatic vicissitudes. Tree mortality peaked, and tree recruitment and growth declined during atypically wet periods. Tree growth was fastest during dry periods, when reduced cloudiness might have increased available solar radiation. Inferences about causality are tenuous because tree data were collected only at multi-year intervals. Mean temperatures and rainfall seasonality have both increased over time in central Amazonia, and these could potentially have long-term effects on forest dynamics and carbon storage. ",

We measured Rs at three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) sites on a climatic gradient from 1997 to 2000 to assess potential responses to global warming. Mean annual Rs varied from 0.67 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the cool site, to 1.19 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the midtransect site, to 1.52 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the warm site. Trenched plots were installed in 1999 to partition Rs into root respiration (Rr) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Differences in trenched-plot respiration (Rt) among sites were much less than differences in Rs, because trenching reduced Rs at the warm site more than at the cool site. Annual Rt was 22% less than annual Rs at the cool site, 36% less at the midtransect site, and 50% less at the warm site. After making adjustments for extraordinary decomposition of killed roots in trenched plots, it was estimated that annual Rh varied little among sites (0.40 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the cool site to 0.54 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the warm site), but annual Rr varied substantially among sites (0.24 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the cool site to 0.98 kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 at the warm site).

Chamber measurements of soil surface CO2 efflux (Fs), wood respiration (Fw) and foliage respiration (Ff) help identify the contributions of these individual components to net ecosystem exchange. Models developed from the chamber data also provide independent estimates of respiration costs. We measured CO2 efflux with chambers periodically in 1996-97 in a ponderosa pine forest in Oregon, scaled these measurements to the ecosystem, and computed annual totals for respiration by component. We also compared estimated half-hourly ecosystem respiration at night (Fnc) with eddy covariance measurements. Mean foliage respiration normalized to 10 Â°C was 0.20 Âµmol m-2 (hemi-leaf surface area) s-1, and reached a maximum of 0.24 Âµmol m-2 HSA s-1 between days 162 and 208. Mean wood respiration normalized to 10 Â°C was 5.9 Âµmol m-3 sapwood s-1, with slightly higher rates in mid-summer, when growth occurs. There was no significant difference (P > 0.10) between wood respiration of young (45 years) and old trees (250 years). Soil surface respiration normalized to 10 Â°C ranged from 0.7 to 3.0 Âµmol m-2 (ground) s-1 from days 23 to 329, with the lowest rates in winter and highest rates in late spring. Annual CO2 flux from soil surface, foliage and wood was 683, 157, and 54 g C m-2 y-1, with soil fluxes responsible for 76% of ecosystem respiration. The ratio of net primary production to gross primary production was 0.45, consistent with values for conifer sites in Oregon and Australia, but higher than values reported for boreal coniferous forests. Below-ground carbon allocation (root turnover and respiration, estimated as Fs- litterfall carbon) consumed 61% of GPP; high ratios such as this are typical of sites with more water and nutrient constraints. The chamber estimates were moderately correlated with change in CO2 storage in the canopy (Fstor) on calm nights (friction velocity u* < 0.25 m s-1; R2 = 0.60); Fstor was not significantly different from summed chamber estimates. On windy nights (u* > 0.25 m s-1), the sum of turbulent flux measured above the canopy by eddy covariance and Fstor was only weakly correlated with summed chamber estimates (R2 = 0.14); the eddy covariance estimates were lower than chamber estimates by 50%.

This paper describes seasonal and annual variation in these factors, and the evaluation of two generalized models of carbon and water balance (PnET-II and 3-PG) with a combination of traditional measurements of NPP, respiration and water stress, and eddy covariance measurements of above-and below-canopy CO2 and water vapour exchange. The objective was to evaluate the models using two years of traditional and eddy covariance measurements, and to use the models to help interpret the relative importance of processes controlling carbon and water vapour exchange in a water-limited pine ecosystem throughout the year. PnET-II is a monthly time-step model that is driven by nitrogen availability through foliar N concentration, and 3-PG is a monthly time-step quantum-efficiency model constrained by extreme temperatures, drought, and vapour pressure deficits. Both models require few parameters and have the potential to be applied at the watershed to regional scale. There was 2/3 less rainfall in 1997 than in 1996, providing a challenge to modelling the water balance, and consequently the carbon balance, when driving the models with the two years of climate data, sequentially. Soil fertility was not a key factor in modelling processes at this site because other environmental factors limited photosynthesis and restricted projected leaf area index to ~1.6. Seasonally, GEP and LE were overestimated in early summer and underestimated through the rest of the year. The model predictions of annual GEP, NEP and water vapour exchange were within 1-39% of flux measurements, with greater disparity in 1997 because soil water never fully recharged. The results suggest that generalized models can provide insights to constraints on productivity on an annual basis, using a minimum of site data. ",

The young forest (Y site) was previously an old-growth ponderosa pine forest that had been clearcut in 1978, and the old forest (O site), which has never been logged, consists of two primary age classes (50 and 250 years old). Total ecosystem carbon content (vegetation, detritus and soil) of the O forest was about twice that of the Y site (21 vs. 10 kg C m-2 ground), and significantly more of the total is stored in living vegetation at the O site (61% vs. 15%). Ecosystem respiration (Re) was higher at the O site (1014 vs. 835 g C m-2 year-1), and it was largely from soils at both sites (77% of Re). The biological data show that above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), NPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) were greater at the O site than the Y site. Monte Carlo estimates of NEP show that the young site is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, and is significantly lower than NEP(O) by c. 100 g C m-2 year-1. Eddy covariance measurements also show that the O site was a stronger sink for CO2 than the Y site. Across a 15-km swath in the region, ANPP ranged from 76 g C m-2 year-1 at the Y site to 236 g C m-2 year-1 (overall mean 158 Â± 14 g C m-2 year-1). The lowest ANPP values were for the youngest and oldest stands, but there was a large range of ANPP for mature stands. Carbon, water and nitrogen cycle simulations with the Biome-BGC model suggest that disturbance type and frequency, time since disturbance, age-dependent changes in below-ground allocation, and increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 all exert significant control on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon at the two sites. Model estimates of major carbon flux components agree with budget-based observations to within Â± 20%, with larger differences for NEP and for several storage terms. Simulations showed the period of regrowth required to replace carbon lost during and after a stand-replacing fire (O) or a clearcut (Y) to be between 50 and 100 years. In both cases, simulations showed a shift from net carbon source to net sink (on an annual basis) 10-20 years after disturbance. These results suggest that the net ecosystem production of young stands may be low because heterotrophic respiration, particularly from soils, is higher than the NPP of the regrowth. The amount of carbon stored in long-term pools (biomass and soils) in addition to short-term fluxes has important implications for management of forests in the Pacific North-west for carbon sequestration.

To assess the temporal and spatial variation in respiration rates of these components in a heterogeneous ponderosa pine forest canopy, and the processes that control these fluxes, we conducted an intensive field study during the summer of 2000. We employed a combination of biological and micrometeorological measurements to assess carbon respiratory fluxes at the soil surface, within and above a 4-m-tall ponderosa pine forest. We also conducted manipulation studies to examine the carbon fluxes from the roots and heteorotrophs.Spatial variation in soil CO2 efflux was large, averaging 40% of the mean, which varied by nearly a factor of two between minima for bare soil to maxima beneath dense patches of understorey vegetation. The estimated vertical profile of respiration from chamber data, and the profile of nocturnal fluxes measured by the three eddy flux systems suggested that >70% of the ecosystem respiration was coming from below the 1.75-m measurement height of one of the flux systems, and 71% of photosynthetic carbon uptake in July was released by soil processes, thus there was a strong vertical gradient in respiration relatively close to the soil surface in this young forest. These results stress the importance of understanding spatial and temporal variation in soil processes when interpreting nocturnal eddy covariance data.",

FLUXNETs goals are to understand the mechanisms controlling the exchanges of CO2, water vapor and energy across a spectrum of time and space scales, and to provide information for modeling of carbon and water cycling across regions and the globe. At a subset of sites, net carbon uptake (net ecosystem exchange, the net of photosynthesis and respiration) was greater under diffuse than under direct radiation conditions, perhaps because of a more efficient distribution of non-saturating light conditions for photosynthesis, lower vapor pressure deficit limitation to photosynthesis, and lower respiration associated with reduced temperature. The slope of the relation between monthly gross ecosystem production and evapotranspiration was similar between biomes, except for tundra vegetation, showing a strong linkage between carbon gain and water loss integrated over the year (slopes=3.4Â gÂ CO2/kgÂ H2O for grasslands, 3.2 for deciduous broadleaf forests, 3.1 for crops, 2.4 for evergreen conifers, and 1.5 for tundra vegetation). The ratio of annual ecosystem respiration to gross photosynthesis averaged 0.83, with lower values for grasslands, presumably because of less investment in respiring plant tissue compared with forests. Ecosystem respiration was weakly correlated with mean annual temperature across biomes, in spite of within site sensitivity over shorter temporal scales. Mean annual temperature and site water balance explained much of the variation in gross photosynthesis. Water availability limits leaf area index over the long-term, and inter-annual climate variability can limit carbon uptake below the potential of the leaf area present.",

The simulations suggest that annual net uptake (net ecosystem production (NEP)) for the whole forested region (8.2 million hectares) was 13.8 Tg C (168 g C m-2 yr-1), with the highest mean uptake in the Coast Range ecoregion (226 g C m-2 yr-1), and the lowest mean NEP in the East Cascades (EC) ecoregion (88 g C m-2 yr-1). Carbon stocks totaled 2765 Tg C (33 700 g C m-2), with wide variability among ecoregions in the mean stock and in the partitioning above- and belowground. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere that is driven by wildfire was relatively low during the late 1990s (~0.1 Tg C yr-1), however, wildfires in 2002 generated a much larger C source (~4.1 Tg C). Annual harvest removals from the study area over the period 1995-2000 were ~5.5 Tg C yr-1. The removals were disproportionately from the Coast Range, which is heavily managed for timber production (approximately 50% of all of Oregon's forest land has been managed for timber in the past 5 years). The estimate for the annual increase in C stored in long-lived forest products and land fills was 1.4 Tg C yr-1. Net biome production (NBP) on the land, the net effect of NEP, harvest removals, and wildfire emissions indicates that the study area was a sink (8.2 Tg C yr-1). NBP of the study area, which is the more heavily forested half of the state, compensated for ~52% of Oregon's fossil carbon dioxide emissions of 15.6 Tg C yr-1 in 2000. The Biscuit Fire in 2002 reduced NBP dramatically, exacerbating net emissions that year. The regional total reflects the strong east-west gradient in potential productivity associated with the climatic gradient, and a disturbance regime that has been dominated in recent decades by commercial forestry.

The diameters of stems >5 cm dbh were measured in nine secondary forests using a stratified random design of nested plots (3000 m2 per site). The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from 1 to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance. ",

Main findings are (1) The Michaelis-Menton model explains >50-65% of the observed variance of the daytime net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) during the growing season; leaf wetness appears to be an important variable contributing to the remaining variance. (2) The whole-ecosystem respiration rate as a function of the 5-cm soil temperature shows a seasonal â€œhysteresisâ€ (higher rate in the later part of the year), suggesting a nonnegligible contribution by deep soil/roots and the influence of litter age. (3) There is evidence of photosynthetic activities immediately after the spring snowmelt/soil warming, but the daily NEE did not switch sign till about 40 days later; our best estimates of the annual net carbon uptake by the ecosystem (net ecosystem production (NEP)) are -1.0, -1.2, and -2.8 t C ha-1 yr-1 for the periods July 19, 1995, to July 18, 1996, January 1 to December 31, 1996, and January 1 to December 31, 1997, respectively, with an uncertainty of Â±0.4 t C ha-1 yr-1. (4) The higher NEP value in 1997 than in 1996 was caused by lower growing season soil temperature, cooler spring and fall transitional periods, and higher photon flux in 1997; possible enhancement in canopy photosynthetic capacity may also have played a role. In addition, three main sources of uncertainties, data gap, fetch, and mass flow, are discussed. It is suggested that collective use of the methods available for assessing the whole-ecosystem respiration (friction velocity threshold, mass flow theory, and dark respiration from the forest light response) may increase the confidence level of NEP estimates.

Soil CO2 flux showed no significant diurnal trend on days without rain. In contrast, rainfall events caused a significant increase in soil CO2 flux. To determine the effect of rainfall events and to evaluate more precisely the daily and annual soil carbon flux, we constructed a multiple polynomial regression model that included two variables, soil temperature and soil water content, using the soil CO2 flux data recorded on sunny days. Daily soil carbon fluxes on sunny days calculated by the model were almost the same as those determined by the field measurements. On the contrary, the fluxes measured on rainy days were significantly higher than those calculated daily from the soil carbon fluxes by the model. Annual soil carbon fluxes in 1999 and 2000 were estimated using models that both do and do not take rainfall effects into consideration. The result indicates that post-rainfall increases in soil CO2 flux represent approximately 16-21% of the annual soil carbon flux in this cool temperate deciduous forest. ",

Root respiration rate (R r) and heterotrophic respiration rate (R h) were estimated from R control, R trench, and R D. We estimated that the contribution of R r to total soil respiration in the growing season ranged from 27 to 71%.

However, the influence of fertilization on belowground processes such as soil respiration, fine root production, and microbial biomass is still unclear. We measured soil respiration, fine root biomass production, and microbial biomass along a fertilization gradient (0, 56, 112, and 224Â kgÂ NÂ ha-1 per year) in 7-year-old cottonwood and loblolly pine plantations, established on a well-drained, Redbay sandy loam (a fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Rhodic Paleudlt), in northwest Florida. Soil respiration was measured monthly from June 2001 to May 2002 using the soda-lime technique. Fine root biomass production was quantified using the ingrowth core method during the same period. In addition, microbial biomass, soil temperature, moisture, soil pH, and organic matter were also measured along the same gradient for both species. Annual soil respiration rate was significantly greater (781Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) in cottonwood than that (692Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) in loblolly pine. Nitrogen fertilization had a significant negative effect on soil respiration in cottonwood, but no effect was observed in loblolly pine stands. Mean daily soil respiration rates exhibited significant exponential relationships with soil temperature both in cottonwood (R2=0.81) and loblolly pine (R2=0.51). Annual soil respiration rates in cottonwood stands were positively correlated with fine root production (r=0.64) and soil microbial biomass C (r=0.87) and negatively correlated with soil pH (r=-0.81). Annual soil respiration in loblolly pine stands was correlated positively with fine root production (r=0.54) and with organic matter content (r=0.74). Annual fine root production was significantly greater in cottonwood (221Â gÂ m-2 per year) than that in loblolly pine (144Â gÂ m-2 per year). Fertilization did not affect fine root production in both species. Microbial biomass, however, was significantly reduced by nitrogen fertilization in both species. We also observed an optimum range of soil pH (6.0Â±0.4), where highest microbial activity could be expected. Multiple regression analysis indicated that microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil pH were the major factors affecting soil respiration in cottonwood, while fine root production and soil organic matter were the major factors affecting soil respiration in loblolly pine. These results suggest that belowground responses to fertilization can vary widely between conifers and hardwoods.",

Since many of the emissions come from energy use, high cost strategies might be required until new technological developments reduce fossil fuel dependency or increase energy utilization efficiency. On the other hand biologically based strategies may be used to offset energy related emissions. Agricultural soil and forestry are among the largest carbon reservoirs on the planet; therefore, agricultural and forest activities may help to reduce the costs of greenhouse gas emission mitigation. However, sequestration exhibits permanence related characteristics that may influence this role. We examine the dynamic role of carbon sequestration in the agricultural and forest sectors can play in mitigation. A 100-year mathematical programming model, depicting U.S. agricultural and forest sectoral activities including land transfers and greenhouse gas consequences is applied to simulate potential mitigation response. The results show that at low cost and in the near term agricultural soil and forest management are dominant sectoral responses. At higher prices and in the longer term biofuels and afforestation take over. Our results reveal that the agricultural and forest sector carbon sequestration may serve as an important bridge to the future helping to hold costs down until energy emissions related technology develops.

Total soil respiration rates were measured during the snow-free season in 2000 and 2001 using an open-flow gas-exchange system with an infrared gas analyzer. To determine the annual carbon emission from the soil, we constructed a polynomial multiple-regression model that included two variables (soil temperature and soil water content) and that used hourly data for soil respiration rates. To estimate root respiration, we used data on the seasonal changes in the contribution of root respiration to the soil respiration rate that were determined in a previous study. The annual root respiration rate was estimated to be 4.8Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1, which corresponds to 45% of the annual total soil respiration (10.6Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1). Thus, root respiration contributed about half of the total annual soil respiration in the cool-temperate forest. The importance of root respiration in determining a forest's carbon balance is discussed in relation to data on net ecosystem production by the same forest.",

Spatial geographic information system data for the Tongass were combined with forest inventory data to estimate and map total carbon stock in the Tongass; the result was 2.8 Â± 0.5 Pg C, or 8% of the total carbon in the forests of the conterminous USA and 0.25% of the carbon in global forest vegetation and soils. Cumulative net carbon loss from the Tongass due to management of the forest for the period 1900-95 was estimated at 6.4-17.2 Tg C. Using our spatially explicit data for carbon stock and net flux, we modeled the potential effect of five management regimes on future net carbon flux. Estimates of net carbon flux were sensitive to projections of the rate of carbon accumulation in second-growth forests and to the amount of carbon left in standing biomass after harvest. Projections of net carbon flux in the Tongass range from 0.33 Tg C annual sequestration to 2.3 Tg C annual emission for the period 1995-2095. For the period 1995-2195, net flux estimates range from 0.19 Tg C annual sequestration to 1.6 Tg C annual emission. If all timber harvesting in the Tongass were halted from 1995 to 2095, the economic value of the net carbon sequestered during the 100-year hiatus, assuming $20/Mg C, would be $4 to $7 million/y (1995 US dollars). If a prohibition on logging were extended to 2195, the annual economic value of the carbon sequestered would be largely unaffected ($3 to $6 million/y). The potential annual economic value of carbon sequestration with management maximizing carbon storage in the Tongass is comparable to revenue from annual timber sales historically authorized for the forest.",

Here, we present the largest chronosequence data set on forest succession in the wet tropics that includes both secondary and old-growth sites. We performed 0.1 ha vegetation inventories in 30 sites in northeastern Costa Rica, including seven old-growth forests and 23 secondary forests on former pastures, ranging from 10 to 42 yr. The secondary forest sites were formerly pasture for intervals of <1-25 yr. Aboveground biomass in secondary forests recovered rapidly, with sites already exhibiting values comparable to old growth after 21-30 yr, and biomass accumulation was not impacted by the length of time that a site was in pasture. Species richness reached old-growth levels in as little as 30 yr, although sites that were in pasture for > 10 yr had significantly lower species richness. Forest cover near the sites at the time of forest establishment did not significantly impact biomass or species richness, and the species composition of older secondary forest sites (>30 yr) converged with that of old growth. These results emphasize the resilience of tropical ecosystems in this region and the high conservation value of secondary forests. RESUMENes Los bosques secundarios constituyen una parte vital del paisaje tropical, y su magnitud e importancia mundial va creciendo. Aqui presentamos el mayor conjunto de datos acerca de una cronosecuencia de bosque tropical lluvioso que incluye sitios en bosque secundario y primario. Realizamos inventarios de vegetacion en 0.1 ha en 30 sitios en el noroeste de Costa Rica, siete en bosque primario y 23 en bosque secundario sobre pastos abandonados, con edades entre 10-42 anos. Los sitios del bosque secundario permanecieron en pastos por periodos de tiempo entre < 1-25 anos antes del abandono. La biomasa se recupera rapidamente, con niveles parecidos a los del bosque primario despues de 21-30 anos, y el periodo de tiempo en que los sitios permanecieron en pastos no afecta a la acumulacion de biomasa. La riqueza de especies llega a ser igual a la del bosque viejo despues de 30 anos, aunque los sitios que estaban pastos por > 10 anos tienen una riqueza significativamente mas baja. La cobertura forestal alrededor de cada sitio en el momento de establecimiento del bosque no afecta significativamente ni la biomasa ni la composicion de especies, y la composicion de especies en bosque secundario viejo (> 30 anos) converge con la del bosque primario. Nuestros resultados destacan la resiliencia de los ecosistemas de esta region y el alto valor de los bosques secundarios para la conservacion. ",

Fluxes were measured using micrometeorological methods and neural network analysis was used to fill gaps in the hourly flux time series. Productivity at Virginia Park is controlled by rainfall amount and timing during the wet season since this determines the leaf area index (Lai) of the C4 grass understorey which varies greatly compared to Lai of the trees. The savanna lost 99Â gÂ CÂ m-2 over the period July 2001-March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002-2003 wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510Â gÂ CÂ m-2 from February 2001 to March 2004, with annual productivity ranging from 1060Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in a normal year to 360Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 during the 2002-2003 drought which affected all of eastern Australia. Annual rainfall at the savanna was matched by annual evapotranspiration, indicating there was no surface runoff or deep drainage during our study. Trees at both sites were able to extract water deep within the soil profile to maintain annual transpiration above rainfall during the drought of 2002-2003.Measurements of Lai and gross primary production (PG) at the two sites were compared to estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data products. The MOD15 algorithm overestimated Lai by a factor of two at Tumbarumba but gave reasonable magnitudes and seasonal variation for the savanna. At Tumbarumba, MOD17 gave excellent estimates of the annual amplitude in PG but was less satisfactory in predicting the phase of the variations. MOD17 overestimated PG at Virginia Park during the dry season and the low-rainfall summer of 2002-2003 but gave satisfactory results during the other two wet seasons. Most of the variance in PG at both sites was explained by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Significantly improved predictions were obtained for the savanna by modifying the MOD17 algorithm to account for rainfall and potential evaporation in the antecedent 3 months, a surrogate for soil water availability.",

Five stands were sampled in each forest. Species composition and richness varied little during succession. Biomass, soil organic matter, total soil nitrogen, and soil water all increased with time. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen were significantly less in thinned forest than in undisturbed forests, but soil moisture did not vary with shrub thinning. Total tree density did not change over time, suggesting that species replacements were not driven by self-thinning. The eventual replacement of shrubs by trees occurred because shrub density decreased whereas tree density remained constant and tree mass increased.",

We found that the secondary forest accumulated the heavy-fraction organic carbon (HF-OC) measured by the density fractionation technique, more efficiently than the tree plantation did. Although there was no significant difference in total soil organic carbon (SOC) between the plantation (5.59Â±0.09 kg m-2) and the secondary forest (5.68Â±0.16 kg m-2), the proportion of HF-OC carbon to the total SOC was significantly higher in the secondary forest (61%) than in the plantation (45%) (P<0.05). Forest floor mass and aboveground litterfall in the plantation were 168% and 22.8% greater than those in the secondary forest, respectively, while the decomposition rate of leaf litter in the plantation was 23.3% lower than that in the secondary forest. The annual mean soil respirations in the plantation and the secondary forest were 2.32Â±0.15 and 2.65Â±0.18 g C m-2 day-1, respectively, with a consistently higher rate in the secondary forest than in the plantation throughout the year. Microbial biomass measured by fumigation-incubation method demonstrated a strong seasonal variation in the secondary forest with 804 mg kg-1 in the wet season and 460 mg kg-1 in the dry season. However, the seasonal change of microbial biomass in the plantation was less significant. Our results suggested that secondary forests could stock more long-term SOC than the plantations in the wet tropics because the naturally generated secondary forest accumulated more HF-OC than the managed plantation.

This paper presents the first full-year-long continuous measurements of net ecosystem CO2 flux (NEE) made over a montane larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) forest in Mongolia from 25 March 2003 to 24 March 2004 (366 days) using the eddy covariance technique. The hourly maximum uptake was -10.1 Âµmol m-2 s-1. The maximum daily uptake of -4.0 g C m-2 d-1 (negative NEE values denote net carbon uptake by the canopy from the atmosphere) occurred in July. The annual cumulative NEE was -85 g C m-2, indicating that the forest acted as a net sink of CO2. We examined the responses of NEE to environmental conditions in the growing season from May to September. Both daytime 30-min mean and daily integrated NEE responded to incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a rectangular hyperbolic fashion. Model results show that the apparent quantum yield (a) was -0.0133 Â± 0.0011 Âµmol CO2 per Âµmol of photons, and the bulk light use efficiency (LUE) on the daily basis was -6.7 mmol CO2 per mole of PAR photons over the entire growing season for this forest. Additionally, daily integrated NEE was also a linear function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a linear function of mean daily air temperature (Ta), and a quadratic polynomial function of daily means of the atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Among these factors, LAI (as measured by NDVI) was dominant in affecting the dynamics of NEE, followed by Ta. Lower Ta was limiting the growth rate of this montane larch forest. As daily means of VPD exceeded 1.2 kPa, net CO2 uptake by the canopy declined. Nevertheless, water stress was not observed as a problem for the forest growth. ",

Soil respiration was significantly reduced where roots were excluded for 7Â years in both the secondary forest and the pine plantation. Microbial biomass was also significantly reduced in the root exclusion plots. In root exclusion treatment, total fungal biomass was on average 31 and 65% lower than the control plots in the pine plantation and the secondary forest, respectively, but the total bacterial biomass was 24 and 8.3% lower than the control plots in the pine plantation and the secondary forest, respectively. Heterotrophic soil respiration was positively correlated with fungal biomass (R2=0.63, R2=0.39), bacterial biomass (R2=0.16, R2=0.45), soil moisture (R2=0.41, R2=0.56), carbon in light fraction (R2=0.45, R2=0.39) and total nitrogen (R2=0.69, R2=0.67) in the pine plantation and the secondary forest, respectively. The regression analysis suggested that fungal biomass might have a greater influence on heterotrophic soil respiration in the pine plantation, while the bacterial biomass might have a greater influence in the secondary forest. Heterotrophic soil respiration was more sensitive to total N than to carbon in the light fraction, and soil moisture was a major factor influencing heterotrophic soil respiration in these forests where temperature is high and relatively invariable.",

Intensive measurements were conducted for a period of 12 months. Soil CO2 emissions were also modeled by multiple regression analysis from daily air temperature, dry-bulb saturated vapor pressure, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, soil moisture, and soil temperature. Data was analyzed based on soil moisture levels and air temperature with annual data being grouped into either hot-humid season or relatively cool season based on the precipitation patterns. This was essential in order to acquire simplifled exponential models for parameter estimation. Minimum and maximum daily mean soil CO2 efflux rates were observed in November and July, with respective rates of 1.98 Â± 0.66 and 11.04 Â± 0.96 Âµmol m-2 s-1 being recorded. Annual average soil CO2 emission (F CO2) was 5.92 Âµmol m-2 s-1. Including all the weather variables into the model helped to explain 73.9% of temporal variability in soil CO2 emission during the measurement period. Soil CO2 efflux increased with increasing soil temperature and soil moisture. Preliminary results showed that Q10, which is deflned as the difierence in respiration rates over a 10 Â°C interval, was partly explained by flne root biomass. Soil temperature and soil moisture were the dominant factors controlling soil CO2 efflux and were regarded as the driving variables for CO2 production in the soil. Including these two variables in regression models could provide a useful tool for predicting the variation of CO2 emission in the commercial forest soils of South China.",

The results were compared with periodic measurements obtained at the same site with an LI-6400 chamber system and an open-top chamber system, and also with continuous measurements obtained at the same site with a soil CO2 gradient system. The diurnal and seasonal changes in Fc measured by the automated chamber and soil CO2 gradient approaches followed the soil temperature patterns. We found only a weak correlation between Fc and soil moisture, probably because the volumetric soil moisture (30-40% at 95% confidence interval) in this larch forest favors microbial and root activities. Among the four approaches, the LI-6400 chamber yielded a substantially higher Fc value than the other three approaches. The open-top chamber gave higher values of Fc than the automated chamber at efflux rates below 3.0Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and lower values above this level; however, the results of both these approaches were closely correlated (R2=0.87, n=105).

In addition, we applied the soil CO2 concentration gradients method to continuously measure soil CO2 profiles under snowpack in the snowy period and to partition Rs into topsoil (Oa and A horizons) CO2 efflux (Ft) with a depth of 0.13 m and sub-soil (C horizon) CO2 efflux (Fc). We found that soil CO2 effluxes were strongly affected by the seasonal variation of soil temperature but weakly correlated with soil moisture, probably because the volumetric soil moisture (30-40% at 95% confidence interval) was within a plateau region for root and microbial activities. The soil CO2 effluxes changed seasonally in parallel with soil temperature in topsoil with the peak in late summer. On the other hand, the contribution of Rr to Rs was the largest at about 50% in early summer, when canopy photosynthesis and plant growth were more active. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of Rr peaked in June. Under snowpack, Rs was stable until mid-March and then gradually increased with snow melting. Rs summed up to 79 gC m-2 during the snowy season for 4 months. The annual Rs was determined at 934 gC m-2 y-1 in 2003, which accounted for 63% of ecosystem respiration. The annual contributions of Rh and Rs to Rs were 57% and 43%, respectively. Based on the gradient approach, Rs was partitioned vertically into litter (Oi and Oe horizons) with a depth of 0.01-0.02 m, topsoil and sub-soil respirations with proportions of 6, 72 and 22%, respectively, on an annual basis. The vertical distribution of CO2 efflux was consistent with those of soil carbon and root biomass. ",

Here, we investigated this issue in three subtropical forests of different maturity [i.e. a young pine forest (PF), a transitional mixed conifer and broadleaf forest (MF) and an old-growth broadleaved forest (BF)] in southern China. Soil respiration was measured over two years under four simulated acid rain (SAR) treatments (CK, the local lake water, pH 4.5; T1, water pH 4.0; T2, water pH 3.5; and T3, water pH 3.0). Results indicated that SAR did not significantly affect soil respiration in the PF, whereas it significantly reduced soil respiration in the MF and the BF. The depressed effects on both forests occurred mostly in the warm-wet seasons and were correlated with a decrease in soil microbial activity and in fine root biomass caused by soil acidification under SAR. The sensitivity of the response of soil respiration to SAR showed an increasing trend with the progressive maturity of the three forests, which may result from their differences in acid buffering ability in soil and in litter layer. These results indicated that the depressed effect of acid rain on soil respiration in southern China may be more pronounced in the future in light of the projected change in forest maturity. However, due to the nature of this field study with chronosequence design and the related pseudoreplication for forest types, this inference should be read with caution. Further studies are needed to draw rigorous conclusions regarding the response differences among forests of different maturity using replicated forest types. ",

Ebenaceae and Euphorbiaceae were the dominant families. The common species in the four habitats were Diospyros maritime, Ficus benjamina and Melanolepis multiglandulosa. Habitat I on the flat terrace was dominated by Bischofia javanica and Palaquium formosanum; habitat II on the ridge of exposed coral reef was dominated by Aglaia formosana and Pouteria obovata; habitat III on the sedimentary basin was dominated by Macaranga tanariu; habitat IV at the bottom of valley was dominated by Pisonia umbellifera. Litter productions, decomposition processes and nutrient returns were monitored over a 12-month period in the four habitats. Bulk litter was gathered from traps for monthly accession of litterfall. Mixed-species litter bags containing equal portions of the individual species were used to measure the decomposition constants of the leaf litter. Fresh and decomposing litters were analyzed for C, N, P, Ca, Mg, K and Na. Experimental results indicated that mean monthly litterfall in all the habitats displayed a marked seasonal pattern, with spring troughs and summer, autumn and winter peaks associated with the typhoon and monsoon seasons. The annual litterfall ranged from 6.98 to 9.13Â MgÂ ha-1Â year-1, is within but in the higher range for tropical forests. The litterfall production in habitats I and IV was significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) exceeding that in habitats II and III. This phenomenon probably occurs because the dominant tree species of habitat II are relatively adapted to strong wind, and the leaves survived for a long time on the exposed coral reef; meanwhile, habitat III comprised secondary forest which was dominated by early succession tree species with lower leaf area index and basal area than those in other habitats. Significant differences in initial C concentration in the leaf litter were observed in the four habitats. Carbon release from the leaf litter was fastest in habitat IV, while the thin and less rigid leaves without prominent skeletal tissues of Pisonia umbellifera are easily decomposed. The mass and nutrients in the leaf litter could be arranged sequentially in order of decreasing mobility: CaÂ >Â MgÂ =Â NÂ >Â NaÂ >Â KÂ >Â PÂ >Â massÂ >Â C. Carbon was returned to the forest floor in the highest amount, and the next element was Ca which ranged from 196 to 324Â kgÂ ha-1Â year-1.

In order to understand carbon fluxes in orange orchards, an experiment was undertaken on traditional and intensive planting systems.The experiment used C. sinensis scions grafted onto Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) rootstock. One orchard contained 14-year-old trees of the cv. Tarocco Sciri¨ (a blood orange) grown in a traditional system with 494 trees/ha. The second orchard contained 12-year-old trees of the cv. Newhall (a seedless navel orange) grown in an intensive system with 1000 trees/ha. Net primary productivity (NPP) was obtained by measuring the annual canopy growth of single orange trees and the above ground dry biomass of the ground cover; soil respiration seasonal pattern was measured with an infrared gas analyser (EGM-4, PP System) from June 2005 to May 2006, every 2 weeks from 12Â·00 noon to 15Â·00 h for maximum respiration and from 02Â·00 to 05Â·00 h for minimum respiration; a 24 h cycle measurement of soil respiration was made every 3 months.Carbon fixation in the fruits and in the canopy of single trees was almost twice as much (10Â·7 kg C/tree) in the traditional than in the intensive system (5Â·5 kg C/tree); however, total NPP of the orchard did not change with planting density, being 5Â·3 t C/ha/year in the traditional system and 5Â·5 t C/ha/year in the intensive one. Carbon fixation by the ground cover was higher in the traditional (1Â·1 t C/ha/year) than in the intensive system (0Â·5 t C/ha/year). Annual soil respiration was 5Â·9 t C/ha/year in the traditional system and 4Â·2 t C/ha/year in the intensive one. The carbon balance was almost four times higher in the intensive system (1Â·8 t C/ha/year) than in the traditional one (0Â·5 t C/ha/year), due to large differences in soil respiration.",

Mean annual litterfall was very sensitive to typhoon frequency and intensity, ranging from 3 to 11 MgÂ·ha<U+0096>1Â·year<U+0096>1. Litterfall was significantly higher in years with strong typhoons than in years without typhoons, and the number of strong typhoons explained 82% of interannual variation in litterfall. Nutrient-use efficiency (dry mass/nutrients in litterfall) was high for N, but low for P compared with other tropical forests. This result supports the idea that the study forest is P limited but not N limited. Nutrient loss via litterfall represents a large percentage of aboveground biomass, especially during years with strong typhoons (e.g., 19%<U+0096>41%, 15%<U+0096>40%, 5%<U+0096>12%, for N, P, and K, respectively). Forests that experience infrequent wind disturbance (e.g., temperate or boreal forests) can gradually regain any lost nutrients prior to the next disturbance; this is different from the situation observed in the Fushan Experimental Forest. At Fu-shan the pattern of not responding to typhoons with a flush of new growth appears to be an adaptation to the frequency with which there are multiple typhoons affecting the forest in a single year. Nutrient loss in litterfall caused by frequent typhoon disturbances appears to limit tree growth and contributes to the very low canopy height of the Fushan Experimental Forest.",

Despite the recognized importance of subtropical forest in regional carbon storage and cycling, uncertainties remain regarding the carbon storage of subtropical forests, and few studies have quantified within-site variation of biomass, making it difficult to evaluate the role of these forests in the global and regional carbon cycles. Using data for a 24-ha census plot in east China, we quantify aboveground biomass, characterize its spatial variation among different habitats, and analyse species relative contribution to the total aboveground biomass of different habitats. The average aboveground biomass was 223.0 Mg ha-1 (bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals [217.6, 228.5]) and varied substantially among four topographically defined habitats, from 180.6 Mg ha-1 (bootstrapped 95% CI [167.1, 195.0]) in the upper ridge to 245.9 Mg ha-1 (bootstrapped 95% CI [238.3, 253.8]) in the lower ridge, with upper and lower valley intermediate. In consistent with our expectation, individual species contributed differently to the total aboveground biomass of different habitats, reflecting significant species habitat associations. Different species show differently in habitat preference in terms of biomass contribution. These patterns may be the consequences of ecological strategies difference among different species. Results from this study enhance our ability to evaluate the role of subtropical forests in the regional carbon cycle and provide valuable information to guide the protection and management of subtropical broad-leaved forest for carbon sequestration and carbon storage.

In the four upland plots, leaf litter fall patterns were highly associated, which points at climatic regulation. Litter resource quality, as represented by nutrient concentrations and area/weight ratio of the leaf litter fall, was comparatively high in the flood plain plot. In the upland plots, concentrations and fluxes of Ca, Mg, K, and P were as low as in oligotrophic central Amazonian upland forests. This questions generalisations that the western peripheral region of the Amazon basin should be less oligotrophic than central Amazonia. The upland plot on the podzolised soil showed the lowest concentrations and fluxes of N. Mean residence times of organic matter and nutrients in the L horizons hardly differed between the five plots, suggesting that edaphic properties and litter resource quality are of little importance in the first step of decomposition. Mean residence time of organic matter in all ectorganic horizons combined (estimated on the basis of litter input and necromass on the forest floor, and uncorrected for dead fine root input) varied from 1.0 y in the flood plain forest, 1.1-3.3 y in the well drained upland forests, and 10.2 y in the forest on the podzolised soil.",

Litterfall was higher in the natural forest than in any of the plantations in 18 of 24 months studied. It was generally high during the dry months and low during wetter months and varied between the 2 years of study. The concentration of nutrient elements in the litterfall to some extent showed a seasonal pattern, most pronounced for K.The four sites could be arranged in this sequence with respect to the rate of nutrient release from decomposing litter after 12 months: J. procera=C. lusitanica>Eucalyptus globulus=natural forest. Nutrient elements and dry weight (DW) followed the release pattern: K > Mg > Ca > DW > N = P. After 24 months, the weight loss was less in the natural forest and C. lusitanica site than in the Eucalyptus globulus and J. procera sites, with 11.8%, 10.6%, 7.2% and 4.6% remaining DW, respectively. The high N to P ratio in litter in the first phase and at the end of decomposition, or during the whole period in the case of Eucalyptus globulus, indicates that P was generally limiting for the decomposition.Owing to the lower amount of litter and its lower nutritional quality, the annual nutrient input by litter of the two exotics generally was much lower than that of J. procera and, in particular, that of the natural forest. A consequence of the less efficient within-stand cycling in the J. procera and natural forest sites may be that the herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings here may benefit more from nutrient elements released from litterfall than plants in the C. lusitanica and Eucalyptus globulus sites.",

While it has been shown that reforesting degraded lands can significantly increase C storage in soils, there are limited studies addressing what processes control soil C in these systems. A study was initiated with the following objectives: 1) quantify the amount of soil C accumulating on reforested mine lands; and 2) examine several biological processes that govern the amount of C sequestered into soil (decomposition, soil respiration and microbial dynamics). A chronosequence approach was used to examine C changes with time in reforested mine lands (years 1, 3, and 8) and unmined regenerating clear-cuts (years 4, 12 and 20). From a C perspective, our results indicated that the young reforested mines (ages 1 and 3) differed significantly from the older mines (age 8) and all regenerating clear-cuts for all parameters examined. However, after 8Â years litterfall, microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N), microbial activity, litter decomposition and CO2 efflux were similar on the mine as that found on the 12-year-old naturally regenerating clear-cut. Although soil organic C (SOC) content was lower on the reforested mines than the regenerating forests, rates of SOC accumulation were greater on the mine sites, likely because the young mine lands were initially devoid of SOC and conditions were suitable for rapid sequestration.",

In addition, a better understanding of the effects of natural disturbances on C cycling is critical, particularly in light of alterations to disturbance regimes that may occur with global climate change. However, quantitative data about how postfire differences in ecosystem structure affect C allocation patterns are lacking. For this study, we examined how above- and belowground C pools, fluxes, and allocation patterns varied with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age in lodgepole pine stands in Yellowstone National Park of four forest types: low (<1000 trees/ha), moderate (7000-40 000 trees/ha), and high tree densities (>50 000 trees/ha) in 13-year-old stands, and in ~110-year-old mature stands. C pools in live biomass and detritus were estimated with allometric equations and direct sampling. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated as aboveground biomass increment plus fine litterfall, and total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) was estimated using a C balance approach. Our results indicate that the magnitude of C pools and fluxes varies greatly with fire-initiated differences in tree density and stand age. Coarse woody debris and mineral soil carbon accounted for the majority of total ecosystem C in young stands (91-99%), in contrast to mature stands where the largest amount of C was found in live biomass (64%). ANPP and TBCA increased with tree density (mean ANPP was 59, 122, and 156 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, and TBCA was 68, 237, and 306 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 for low-, moderate-, and high-density young stands, respectively), and with stand age (ANPP was 218 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 and TBCA was 382 g CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 for 110-year-old stands). ANPP and TBCA were positively correlated, and both variables were well correlated with leaf area index. Notably, the ratio of TBCA to (TBCA + ANPP) remained remarkably constant (0.63-0.66) across extreme gradients of tree density and stand age, differing only slightly for the low-density young stands (0.54). These results suggest that C allocation patterns in a postfire lodgepole pine ecosystem are independent of tree density and stand age. ",

We reviewed existing literature and compiled annual carbon budgets for forest ecosystems to test a series of hypotheses addressing the patterns, plasticity, and limits of three components of allocation: biomass, the amount of material present; flux, the flow of carbon to a component per unit time; and partitioning, the fraction of gross primary productivity (GPP) used by a component. Can annual carbon flux and partitioning be inferred from biomass? Our survey revealed that biomass was poorly related to carbon flux and to partitioning of photosynthetically derived carbon, and should not be used to infer either. Are component fluxes correlated? Carbon fluxes to foliage, wood, and belowground production and respiration all increased linearly with increasing GPP (a rising tide lifts all boats). Autotrophic respiration was strongly linked to production for foliage, wood and roots, and aboveground net primary productivity and total belowground carbon flux (TBCF) were positively correlated across a broad productivity gradient. How does carbon partitioning respond to variability in resources and environment? Within sites, partitioning to aboveground wood production and TBCF responded to changes in stand age and resource availability, but not to competition (tree density). Increasing resource supply and stand age, with one exception, resulted in increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to TBCF. Partitioning to foliage production was much less sensitive to changes in resources and environment. Overall, changes in partitioning within a site in response to resource supply and age were small (<15% of GPP), but much greater than those inferred from global relationships. Across all sites, foliage production plus respiration, and total autotrophic respiration appear to use relatively constant fractions of GPP - partitioning to both was conservative across a broad range of GPP - but values did vary across sites. Partitioning to aboveground wood production and to TBCF were the most variable - conditions that favored high GPP increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to TBCF. Do priorities exist for the products of photosynthesis? The available data do not support the concept of priorities for the products of photosynthesis, because increasing GPP increased all fluxes. All facets of carbon allocation are important to understanding carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystem models require information on partitioning, yet we found few studies that measured all components of the carbon budget to allow estimation of partitioning coefficients. Future studies that measure complete annual carbon budgets contribute the most to understanding carbon allocation. ",

We quantified the effect of a non-native C4 grass invasion on soil C pools and fluxes in a Hawaiian tropical dry forest over 2 years in which annual precipitation was average (Year 1) and ~60% higher than average (Year 2). Work was conducted in a series of forested plots where the grass understory was completely removed (removal plots) or left intact (grass plots) for 3 years before experiment initiation. We hypothesized that grass invasion would: (i) not change total soil C pools, (ii) increase the flux of C into and out of soils, and (iii) increase the sensitivity of soil C flux to variability in precipitation. In grass plots, grasses accounted for 25-34% of litter layer C and ~70% of fine root C. However, no differences were observed between treatments in the size of any soil C pools. Moreover, grass-derived C constituted a negligible fraction of the large mineral soil C pool (< 3%) despite being present in the system for =50 years. Tree litterfall was ~45% lower in grass plots, but grass-derived litterfall more than compensated for this reduction in both years. Annual cumulative soil-surface CO2 efflux (Rsoil) was ~40% higher in grass plots in both years, and increased in both treatments by ~36% in the wetter Year 2. Despite minimal grass-derived mineral soil C, > 75% of Rsoil in grass plots was of C4 (i.e. grass) origin. These results demonstrate that grass invasion in forest ecosystems can increase the flux of C into and out of soils without changing total C pools, at least over the short term and as long as the native tree canopy remains intact, and that invasion-mediated changes in belowground C cycling are sensitive to precipitation.

The objectives of this study were to quantify how the (i) magnitude, (ii) plot-level spatial variability, and (iii) plot-level diel variability of FS vary with MAT. To address the first objective, annual FS budgets were constructed by measuring instantaneous FS monthly in all plots for one year. For the second objective, we compared plot-level mean instantaneous FS in six plots derived from 8 versus 16 measurements, and conducted a power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes. For the third objective, we measured instantaneous FS hourly for 24Â h in three plots (cool, intermediate and warm MATs). The magnitude of annual FS and the spatial variability of plot-level instantaneous FS increased linearly with MAT, likely due to concomitant increases in stand productivity. Mean plot-level instantaneous FS from 8 versus 16 measurements per plot yielded statistically similar patterns. The number of samples required to estimate plot-level instantaneous FS within 10% and 20% of the actual mean increased with MAT. In two of three plots examined, diel variability in instantaneous FS was significantly correlated with soil temperature but minimal diel fluctuations in soil temperature (<0.6Â Â°C) resulted in minimal diel variability in FS. Our results suggest that as MAT increases in tropical montane wet forests, FS will increase and become more spatially variable if ecosystem characteristics and functioning undergo concurrent changes as measured along this gradient. However, diel variation in FS will remain a minor component of overall plot-level variation.",

Regardless of the land uses or management practices, the effluxes over a 12-month period had a seasonal pattern, with the maximum effluxes observed in summer and the minimum in winter. Whereas there was no significant difference in the total annual soil CO2 efflux between the natural broadleaf evergreen forest (BL) and the conventionally managed bamboo forests (CM), soil CO2 efflux in the intensively managed bamboo forest (IM) was significantly higher. Soil temperature was the most important environmental factor affecting soil CO2 efflux rates for all three land uses. Soil moisture also had a significant positive correlation with soil CO2 efflux rates. Soil temperature and moisture had greater influence on soil CO2 efflux rate in the IM than the CM and BL forests. Soil dissolved organic C had a positive correlation with soil CO2 efflux rate in the CM, but had no significant correlation with that in the IM or the BL forests. Our study for the first time demonstrated that conversion of the natural subtropical broadleaf evergreen forest to Moso bamboo does not increase soil CO2 efflux. However, when bamboo forests are under intensive management with regular tillage, fertiliser application and weeding, significantly more soil CO2 emission occurs. Therefore, best management practices should be developed to reduce soil CO2 efflux in Moso bamboo plantations in the subtropical regions of China.",

As well as examining seasonal patterns in net ecosystem exchange (NE), daily, seasonal and annual estimates of the canopy photosynthesis (or gross primary productivity, GP) were obtained using NE and ecosystem respiration measurements.Although the forest was a small (but significant) source of CO2 throughout the snow season (typically mid-October to early May) there was a rapid commencement of photosynthetic capacity shortly following the commencement of above-zero air temperatures in spring: in 1999 the forest went from a quiescent state to significant photosynthetic activity in only a few days. Nevertheless, canopy photosynthetic capacity was observed to continue to increase slowly throughout the summer months for both 1999 and 2000, reaching a maximum capacity in early August. During September there was a marked decline in canopy photosynthesis which was only partially attributable to less favourable environmental conditions. This suggests a reduction in canopy photosynthetic capacity in autumn, perhaps associated with the cold hardening process. For individual time periods the canopy photosynthetic rate was mostly dependent upon incoming photon irradiance. However, reductions in both canopy conductance and overall photosynthetic rate in response to high canopy-to-air vapour differences were clearly evident on hot dry days. The relationship between canopy conductance and photosynthesis was examined using Cowan's notion of optimality in which stomata serve to maximise the marginal evaporative cost of plant carbon gain. The associated Lagrangian multiplier (<U+03BB>) was surprisingly constant throughout the growing season. Somewhat remarkably, however, its value was markedly different between years, being 416 mol mol-1 in 1999 but 815 mol mol-1 in 2000. Overall the forest was a substantial sink for CO2 in both 1999 and 2000: around 13 mol C m-2 a-1. Data from this experiment, when combined with estimates of net primary productivity from biomass sampling suggest that about 20% of this sink was associated with increasing plant biomass and about 80% with an increase in the litter and soil organic carbon pools. This high implied rate of carbon accumulation in the litter soil organic matter pool seems unsustainable in the long term and is hard to explain on the basis of current knowledge.",

The diurnal pattern of flux was similar to that found in other tropical forests, with mean daytime NEE ca. - 18 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 and mean nighttime NEE 4.6 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1. However, because ~ 80% of the nighttime data in this forest were collected during low u* conditions (< 0.2 m s-1), nighttime NEE was likely underestimated. Using an alternative analysis, mean nighttime NEE increased to 7.05 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1. There were interannual differences in NEE, but seasonal differences were not apparent. Irradiance accounted for ~ 51% of the variation in the daytime fluxes, with temperature and vapour pressure deficit together accounting for another ~ 20%. Light compensation points ranged from 100 to 207 Âµmol PPFD m-2 s-1. No was relationship was found between 30-min nighttime NEE and tower-top air temperature. A weak relationship was found between hourly nighttime NEE and canopy air temperature using data averaged hourly over the entire sampling period (Q10 = 1.79, R2 = 0.17). The contribution of below-sensor storage was fairly constant from day to day. Our data indicate that this forest was a slight carbon source in 1998 (0.05 to -1.33 t C ha-1 yr-1), a moderate sink in 1999 (-1.53 to -3.14 t C ha-1 yr-1), and a strong sink in 2000 (-5.97 to -7.92 t C ha-1 yr-1). This trend is interpreted as relating to the dissipation of warm-phase El Nino effects over the course of this study. ",

They provide a wide range of ecosystem services that includes carbon storage in above- and below ground biomass and in soils. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil, or soil respiration is important in the global carbon budget and is sensitive to increasing global temperature. To understand the magnitude of mangrove soil respiration and the influence of forest structure and temperature on the variation in mangrove soil respiration I assessed soil respiration at eleven mangrove sites, ranging from latitude 27Â°N to 37Â°S. Mangrove soil respiration was similar to those observed for terrestrial forest soils. Soil respiration was correlated with leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground net primary production (litterfall), which should aid scaling up to regional and global estimates of soil respiration. Using a carbon balance model, total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) per unit litterfall was similar in tall mangrove forests as observed in terrestrial forests, but in scrub mangrove forests TBCA per unit litter fall was greater than in terrestrial forests, suggesting mangroves allocate a large proportion of their fixed carbon below ground under unfavorable environmental conditions. The response of soil respiration to soil temperature was not a linear function of temperature. At temperatures below 26Â°C Q10 of mangrove soil respiration was 2.6, similar to that reported for terrestrial forest soils. However in scrub forests soil respiration declined with increasing soil temperature, largely because of reduced canopy cover and enhanced activity of photosynthetic benthic microbial communities.",

We partitioned total soil surface CO2 efflux (RS) into heterotrophic (RH) and rhizospheric (RR) components across the growing season of 2009. We found that the temporal variation of RR and RH can be well explained by soil temperature (T5) at 5Â cm depth using exponential equations for all forests. However, RR of 40-year-old and 48-year-old forests peaked in September, while their T5 peaks occurred in August. RR of 80-year-old and 143-year-old forests showed a similar pattern to T5. The contribution of RR to RS (RC) of 40-year-old andÂ 48-year-old forests presented a second peak in September. Seasonal variation of RR may be accounted for by the different successional stages. Cumulative RH and RR during the growing season varied with forest age. The estimated RH values for 40-year-old, 48-year-old, 80-year-old and 143-year-old forests averaged 431.72, 452.02, 484.62 and 678.93Â gÂ CÂ m-2, respectively, while the corresponding values of RR averaged 191.94, 206.51, 321.13 and 153.03Â gÂ CÂ m-2. The estimated RC increased from 30.78% in the 40-year-old forest to 39.85% in the 80-year-old forest and then declined to 18.39% in the 143-year-old forest. We found soil organic carbon (SOC), especially the light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), stock at 0-10Â cm soil depth correlated well with RH. There was no significant relationship between RR and fine root biomass regardless of stand age. Measured apparent temperature sensitivity (Q10) of RH (3.93Â Â±Â 0.27) was significantly higher than that of RR (2.78Â Â±Â 0.73). Capillary porosity decreased as stand age increased and it was negatively correlated to cumulative RS.

The chronosequence consisted of three 40-year-old, 48-year-old, 80-year-old, and 143-year-old oak stands, respectively. RS measurements were conducted using a Li-8100 soil CO2 flux system from October 2008 to October 2009. Temporal variations of RS of all the four forests largely depended on soil temperature of 5Â cm depth (T5) (R2 = 0.738-0.825). The mean RS for 40-year-old, 48-year-old, 80-year-old, and 143-year-old forests were 2.37, 2.59, 2.99, and 3.32Â Âµmol CO2 m-2Â s-1 respectively. Both top soil organic carbon (SOC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) stocks were significantly correlated to RS variation, while only significant different LFOC among stands was found. This indicated that cumulated labile organic carbon was a better indicator on RS variation, which was further illustrated by a better relationship between R 10 and LFOC than that of R10 and SOC. We found that the variation of mean RS among stands was well correlated with basal area (BA). Marginal correlation between RS and fine root biomass (FR) demonstrated the relationship between RS and belowground metabolism. We also found total porosity (TP) negatively influenced the mean RS and this negative effect may mainly be attributed to the capillary porosity (CP). Forest growth and yield could be contributed to RS variation among stands. Forest succession also changed soil labile carbon stock and soil physical properties that influenced the CO2 efflux.",

However, its effects on soil CO2 efflux (RS) temporally and spatially are still poorly understood. Biotic and abiotic factors that control spatio-temporal variation of RS were assessed in a naturally regenerated oak forest (OF) and a nearby PP in a warm temperate area of China. We hypothesized that spatial variation of RS in PP is lower than that in OF and is less influenced by biotic factors due to its homogeneous stand structure compared to the regenerated OF. RS measurement campaigns were conducted in two 40Â mÂ xÂ 60Â m plots in OF and PP from Oct. 2008 to Oct. 2009. Soil temperature at 5Â cm depth (T5) exerted considerable influence on the temporal variation in RS. However, the spatial variation of RS was not affected by T5 in either PP or OF. The observed spatial pattern of RS remained comparatively consistent throughout the measurement campaigns for both forests. Soil chemical and physical parameters such as soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), total nitrogen (TN), bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), water-filled pore space (WFPS), and water-holding capacity (WHC) had significant impact on the spatial variation of RS for both OF and PP. We found that biotic factors such as fine root biomass (FR) and stand structure parameters including basal area (BA), maximum diameter at breast height (max. DBH), and mean DBH within 4-5Â m of the measurement points had significant influence on the spatial variation of RS in OF, while no similar significant correlation was found in PP. A stepwise multi-linear regression showed that water-holding capacity (WHC), max. DBH within 4Â m of the measurement points (max. DBH4), and total porosity (TP) contributed 68.7% to the spatial variation of RS in OF, while light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and bulk density (BD) accounted for 46.9% of the spatial variation of RS in PP. These differentiated the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in controlling the spatial variation of RS between the naturally regenerated OF and the artificially regenerated monoculture PP. Therefore, compared to OF, relatively lower coefficients of spatial variation for RS were observed in PP across the year, which was partly attributed to its simple stand structure of PP. Our findings are valuable for accurately estimating regional carbon fluxes by considering the spatio-temporal variation of RS in artificially and naturally regenerated forests.",

However, the factors influencing the spatial distribution of Q10 values within warm temperate forests are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the spatial variation of Q10 values and its controlling factors in both a naturally regenerated oak forest (OF) and a pine plantation (PP). Q10 values were determined based on monthly soil respiration (RS) measurements at 35 subplots for each stand from Oct. 2008 to Oct. 2009. Large spatial variation of Q10 values was found in both OF and PP, with their respective ranges from 1.7 to 5.12 and from 2.3 to 6.21. In PP, fine root biomass (FR) (R = 0.50, P = 0.002), non-capillary porosity (NCP) (R = 0.37, P = 0.03), and the coefficients of variation of soil temperature at 5 cm depth (CV of T5) (R = -0.43, P = 0.01) well explained the spatial variance of Q10. In OF, carbon pool lability reflected by light fractionation method (LLFOC) well explained the spatial variance of Q10 (R = -0.35, P = 0.04). Regardless of forest type, LLFOC and FR correlation with the Q10 values were significant and marginally significant, respectively; suggesting a positive relationship between substrate availability and apparent Q10 values. Parameters related to gas diffusion, such as average soil water content (SWC) and NCP, negatively or positively explained the spatial variance of Q10 values. Additionally, we observed significantly higher apparent Q10 values in PP compared to OF, which might be partly attributed to the difference in soil moisture condition and diffusion ability, rather than different substrate availabilities between forests. Our results suggested that both soil chemical and physical characters contributed to the observed large Q10 value variation. ",

Forests of mixed species composition and lacking numerical dominance by pioneer species were also observed. Transformed Divergence Analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) radiance data revealed that forests of varying age and following different regeneration pathways were best discriminated using mid infrared (1.55-1.74 w m) wavelengths. As rates of carbon sequestration by forests vary with age and regeneration pathway, the potential exists for refining spatial estimates of the carbon balance of tropical forests regenerating on abandoned agricultural lands.

The study was conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest between 1980 and 1984. Comparisons included a variety of demographic, production, and nutrient cycling characteristics of stands. Although the small unmanaged plantations had a lower number of species in understory than paired secondary forests, the understory of the older plantations developed high species richness, including many of native tree species. After 17 yr, native tree species invaded the overstory of plantations. After 50 years the species richness in the understory of a mahogany plantation approached that of its paired secondary forest. Plantation understories had important ecological roles, including high nutrient accumulation. Understory plant tissue, particularly leaf litter, had higher nutrient concentration in pine plantations than in paired secondary forests. Understory biomass in plantations accumulated a higher proportion of the total nutrient inventory in the stand than did the understory in paired secondary forests. Plantations had higher aboveground biomass and net aboveground biomass production than paired secondary forests. Higher root densities and biomass were found in secondary forests as were greater depth of root penetration, higher nutrient concentration in roots, and more microsites where roots grow, than paired plantations. These characteristics may improve the capacity of secondary forests relative to that of paired plantations to rapidly recapture nutrients that become available by mineralization and that could otherwise be lost through hydrological or gaseous pathways. Both forest types accumulated nutrients and mass, but secondary forests recirculated nutrients much faster than the plantations, which tended to store the nutrients. Plantations had higher leaf fall and total litterfall, had litterfall with lower nutrient concentrations, accumulated more nutrients in litter, decomposed more litter on an annual basis, exhibited more variation in the spatial distribution of litter mass, and had more month-to-month variation in litter storage than paired secondary forests. Litter of the secondary forests, on the other hand, had a faster nutrient turnover than plantation litter, though plantations retranslocated more nutrients before leaf fall than did secondary forests. Nutrient retranslocation increased with plantation age. Plantations, particularly pine plantations, produced more litter mass per unit nutrient return than did paired secondary forests. Total nutrient storage in soil gave the best correlation with nutrient use efficiency estimated as element: mass ratios in various compartments. Nutrient use efficiency ranked differently among forest pairs, depending upon which nutrient and ecosystem parameters were being compared. Because of high retranslocation of nutrients, and in spite of greater nutrient ""need"" to produce higher biomass, plantations had nutrient demands on soil similar to paired secondary forests. Among the ecosystem parameters measured, nutrients in leaf fall correlated best with differences in soil nutrients across stands. Nutrient concentrations in understory species appeared to be a sensitive indicator of whole-stand nutrient use efficiency. Some of the observations of the study could be attributed to intrinsic differences between small unmanaged plantations and secondary forests, but many could be explained by species differences (i.e., timing of leaf fall), age of plantation (i.e., accumulation of biomass or species), or the relative importance of angiosperms and gymnosperms (i.e., nutritional quality of litter). The study challenges the conventional dogma with respect to differences between plantations and native successional ecosystems and underscores the dangers of generalizing about all tropical tree plantations or all natural tropical forests, or even extrapolating from one sector of the ecosystem to another.",

The nature of such variations may depend upon the soil type, which in turn, is closely linked to local or regional topography. This study characterizes the soil and describes the status of carbon and nitrogen in vegetation, litterfall, litter-layer and soil upper layers along the main positions of a topographic gradient (plateau, slope and valley), 60 km north of Manaus, on Cuieiras Reserve watershed. Nitrogen concentrations in living leaves, fresh litterfall, litter-layer and soil upper layers were lower in the valley than in both slope and plateau plots. Carbon concentrations in plant material were not significantly different among the three topographic positions, resulting in higher C : N ratios in valley plots. Local topography (plateau, slope and valley) clearly was an influential factor in the nutrient distribution along the study locations. Lower rates of N cycling processes in the valley are probably related to its sandy soil texture and seasonal flooding. ",

Standing root biomass, fine root turnover and mycorrhizal colonization of the following Populus species was examined: Populus alba L., Populus nigra L., Populus x euramericana Dode (Guinier). Elevated CO2 increased belowground allocation of biomass in all three species examined, standing root biomass increased by 47-76% as a result of FACE treatment. Similarly, fine root biomass present in the soil increased by 35-84%. The FACE treatment resulted in 55% faster fine root turnover in P. alba and a 27% increase in turnover of roots of P. nigra and P. x euramericana. P. alba and P. nigra invested more root biomass into deeper soil horizon under elevated CO2. Response of the mycorrhizal community to elevated CO2 was more varied, the rate of infection increased only in P. alba for both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). The roots of P. nigra showed greater infection only by AM and the colonization of the root system of P. x euramericana was not affected by FACE treatment. The results suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions induce greater belowground biomass investment, which could lead to accumulation of assimilated C in the soil profile.

The average summertime net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was highly variable between sites. However, all sites with complete annual datasets, seven in total, acted as annual net sinks for atmospheric CO2.

After this correction neither Reco (P= 0.162) nor GPP (P= 0.110) correlated significantly with NEE on an annual basis. Spatial variation in annual and summertime Reco was associated with growing season period, air temperature, growing degree days, normalized difference vegetation index and vapour pressure deficit. GPP showed weaker correlations with environmental variables as compared with Reco, the exception being leaf area index (LAI), which correlated with both GPP and NEE, but not with Reco. Length of growing season period was found to be the most important variable describing the spatial variation in summertime GPP and Reco; global warming will thus cause these components to increase. Annual GPP and NEE correlated significantly with LAI and pH, thus, in order to predict wetland C exchange, differences in ecosystem structure such as leaf area and biomass as well as nutritional status must be taken into account.

In this study, eddy covariance measurements over a 100-year old-growth chamise-dominated chaparral shrub ecosystem were conducted for 7 years from 1996 to 2003. A carbon sink, from -96 to -155 g C m-2 yr-1, was determined under normal weather conditions, while a weak sink of -18 g C m-2 yr-1 and a strong source of 207 g C m-2 yr-1 were observed as a consequence of a severe drought. The annual sink strength of carbon in the 7-year measurement period was -52 g C m-2 yr-1. The results from our study indicate that, in contrast to previous thought, the old-growth chaparral shrub ecosystem can be a significant sink of carbon under normal weather conditions and, therefore, be an important component of the global carbon budget.

Location Global. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We examined the contribution of large trees to forest density, richness and biomass using a global network of 48 large (from 2 to 60 ha) forest plots representing 5,601,473 stems across 9,298 species and 210 plant families. This contribution was assessed using three metrics: the largest 1% of trees =Â 1 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), all trees =Â 60 cm DBH, and those rank-ordered largest trees that cumulatively comprise 50% of forest biomass. Results Averaged across these 48 forest plots, the largest 1% of trees =Â 1 cm DBH comprised 50% of aboveground live biomass, with hectare-scale standard deviation of 26%. Trees =Â 60 cm DBH comprised 41% of aboveground live tree biomass. The size of the largest trees correlated with total forest biomass (r2 = .62, p < .001). Large-diameter trees in high biomass forests represented far fewer species relative to overall forest richness (r2 = .45, p < .001). Forests with more diverse large-diameter tree communities were comprised of smaller trees (r2 = .33, p < .001). Lower large-diameter richness was associated with large-diameter trees being individuals of more common species (r2 = .17, p = .002). The concentration of biomass in the largest 1% of trees declined with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .46, p < .001), as did forest density (r2 = .31, p < .001). Forest structural complexity increased with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .26, p < .001). Main conclusions Because large-diameter trees constitute roughly half of the mature forest biomass worldwide, their dynamics and sensitivities to environmental change represent potentially large controls on global forest carbon cycling. We recommend managing forests for conservation of existing large-diameter trees or those that can soon reach large diameters as a simple way to conserve and potentially enhance ecosystem services.

A large amount of the terrestrial sink is realized by forests. However, considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fate of this carbon over both short and long timescales. Relevant data to address these uncertainties are being collected at many sites around the world, but syntheses of these data are still sparse. To facilitate future synthesis activities, we have assembled a comprehensive global database for forest ecosystems, which includes carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (e.g. leaf area index, age), as well as ancillary site information such as management regime, climate, and soil characteristics. This publicly available database can be used to quantify global, regional or biome-specific carbon budgets; to re-examine established relationships; to test emerging hypotheses about ecosystem functioning [e.g. a constant net ecosystem production (NEP) to gross primary production (GPP) ratio]; and as benchmarks for model evaluations. In this paper, we present the first analysis of this database. We discuss the climatic influences on GPP, net primary production (NPP) and NEP and present the CO2 balances for boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes based on micrometeorological, ecophysiological, and biometric flux and inventory estimates. Globally, GPP of forests benefited from higher temperatures and precipitation whereas NPP saturated above either a threshold of 1500 mm precipitation or a mean annual temperature of 10 Â°C. The global pattern in NEP was insensitive to climate and is hypothesized to be mainly determined by nonclimatic conditions such as successional stage, management, site history, and site disturbance. In all biomes, closing the CO2 balance required the introduction of substantial biome-specific closure terms. Nonclosure was taken as an indication that respiratory processes, advection, and non-CO2 carbon fluxes are not presently being adequately accounted for. ",

We measured total emission from the soil surface and, separately, respiration from the litter and mineral soil horizons during the warm (snowless) seasons of 2010 and 2011 on differently aged fallow plots: 0 years (cropland) and 7, 23, 55, 100, and 170 years. It was demonstrated that changes in the CO2 emission in the course of the succession have a nonlinear pattern: the emission sharply increases in the first decade, then somewhat decreases, and then gradually increases again up to the maximum values. This is explained by the dependence of the rate of the emission on the soil carbon pools (humus + litter + underground phytomass) that are also subjected to nonlinear changes. Initially, the emission is mainly due to mineralization of labile organic substances added to the plowed soils in the form of organic fertilizers. Then, in parallel with a gradual increase in the pools of litter and underground phytomass, the total pool of soil organic carbon increases, and its role in the emission becomes more pronounced. The seasonal dynamics of the soil respiration are mainly controlled by the soil temperature; the soil moistening plays an important role only during the initial meadow stage of the succession.",

The measurements were made from 2000 to 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. Annual net carbon exchange (NEE) ranged from -155 to -56Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 and from -88 to 141Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 at the savanna and nearby grassland, respectively. Inter-annual variability in NEE was significantly related to length of growing season for the savanna, grassland, and tree canopy. We partitioned the NEE into two separate terms-primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (ecosystem respiration, Reco)-and found that the GPP and Reco of the savanna and grassland depended primarily on the amount of seasonal precipitation that occurred while grass and tree canopies were simultaneously active rather than depending on annual precipitation. We also found that NEE was greatly constrained by both Reco and GPP and Reco was significantly constrained by GPP. Reco increased by 79Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 with each 100Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 increase in GPP. In addition, measuring CO2 exchange separately in the overstory and understory of the savanna over multiple years enabled us to partition Reco into heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration terms in a new and direct way. The sensitivity of Reco to GPP (dReco/dGPP) and the baseline of respiration terms both provide useful tools for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem CO2 uptake under current conditions of climate and ecosystem succession stage.",

NPP of the 21-year-old forest was estimated by using the BIOME BGC model; and both measured NPP and estimated NPP were compared with flux data. Community biomass was 10574 g Â· m-2; its distribution patterns in tree layer, shrub layer, herbaceous layer, tree root, herbaceous and shrub roots and fine roots were 7542, 480, 239, 1810, 230, 274 and 239 g Â· m-2, respectively.

Average Sff was significantly greater in unfertilized relative to the fertilized stands; however, there was no difference in average Sms among treatments. Soil temperature and the mass of the forest floor (litter) explained most of the difference in Sff among treatments. Soil temperature and volumetric water content accounted for 70% of the seasonal variation in Sff. Annual carbon efflux from the soil averaged 14.1 MgÂ·ha-1 per year for all treatments. Most of the evolved carbon was derived from root respiration (50-73%). Net ecosystem productivity was -1.1 and 6.9 Mg CÂ·ha-1 per year for the unfertilized and fertilized stands, respectively.

Annual carbon use in RA was 7.5, 9.0, 15.0, and 15.1 Mg C ha-1 in control (C), irrigated (I), fertilized (F) and irrigated and fertilized (IF) treatments, respectively. Foliage, fine root and perennial woody tissue (stem, branch, coarse and taproot) respiration accounted for, respectively, 37%, 24%, and 39% of RA in C and I treatments and 38%, 12% and 50% of RA in F and IF treatments. Annual gross primary production (GPP=NPP+RA) ranged from 13.1 to 26.6 Mg C ha-1. The I, F, and IF treatments resulted in a 21, 94, and 103% increase in GPP, respectively, compared to the C treatment. Despite large treatment differences in NPP, RA, and carbon allocation, carbon use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) averaged 0.42 and was unaffected by manipulating site resources. Ecosystem respiration (RE), the sum of Sff, and above ground RA, ranged from 12.8 to 20.2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Sff contributed the largest proportion of RE, but the relative importance of Sff decreased from 0.63 in C treatments to 0.47 in IF treatments because of increased aboveground RA. Aboveground woody tissue RA was 15% of RE in C and I treatments compared to 25% of RE in F and IF treatments. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP=GPP-RE) was roughly 0 in the C and I treatments and 6.4 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in F and IF treatments, indicating that non-fertilized treatments were neither a source nor a sink for atmospheric carbon while fertilized treatments were carbon sinks. In these young stands, NEP is tightly linked to NPP; increased ecosystem carbon storage results mainly from an increase in foliage and perennial woody biomass. ",

During the rainy seasons of 2005 and 2006, soil respiration was measured using soda lime traps, particulate and dissolved organic C (POC and DOC) moving by saturated flow was sampled continuously at 0.15 and 0.3 m, and soil was sampled to 2.0 m. Black C was found below the application depth of 0-0.1 m in the 0.15-0.3 m depth interval, with migration rates of 52.4Â±14.5, 51.8Â±18.5 and 378.7Â±196.9 kg C ha-1 yr-1 (Â±SE) where 11.6, 23.2 and 116.1 t BC ha-1, respectively, had been applied. Over 2 years after application, 2.2% of BC applied at 23.2 t BC ha-1 was lost by respiration, and an even smaller fraction of 1% was mobilized by percolating water. Carbon from BC moved to a greater extent as DOC than POC. The largest flux of BC from the field (20-53% of applied BC) was not accounted for by our measurements and is assumed to have occurred by surface runoff during intense rain events. Black C caused a 189% increase in aboveground biomass production measured 5 months after application (2.4-4.5 t additional dry biomass ha-1 where BC was applied), and this resulted in greater amounts of non-BC being respired, leached and found in soil for the duration of the experiment. These increases can be quantitatively explained by estimates of greater belowground net primary productivity with BC addition. ",

We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5Â cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRP was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRP correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere.",

Seasonal average CO2 efflux from plots with LR (3070Â g CO2 m-2 season-1) was twice as high as that from plots without LR (1447Â g CO2 m-2 season-1). Less than 40% of this difference was accounted for by the decay of logging residues (530Â g CO2 m-2 season-1), so the majority of the increased CO2 efflux was caused by increased soil organic matter decomposition under the LR. Furthermore LR increased soil N2O fluxes over 3-fold (0.70Â g N2O m-2 season-1), compared to plots without LR (0.19Â g N2O m-2 season-1), while no change in CH4 emissions was observed. Our results indicate that LR retention in clearfelled peatland sites may significantly increase GHG emissions and C release from the soil organic matter C storage. This would make the harvesting of LR for biofuel more beneficial, in the form of avoided emissions. Further investigations of the sources of CO2 under logging residues are, however, needed to confirm this finding.",

In recent years, their influence on atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and water vapor has become the subject of much speculation. Here we present results from a yearlong study of CO2 fluxes at a tropical forest in central Amazonia, using the micrometeorological technique of eddy covariance. The diurnal cycle of CO2 flux was consistent with previous short-term studies in tropical rain forests, implying that the Amazonian rain forest shows a fair degree of spatial uniformity in bulk ecophysiological characteristics. Typical peak daytime photosynthesis rates were 24-28 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1, and respiration rates were 6-8 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1. There was significant seasonality in peak photosynthesis over the year, which appeared strongly correlated with soil moisture content. On the other hand, there was no evidence of strong seasonality in soil respiration. Central Amazonia has only a short, 3-month dry season, not atypical of tropical rain forest, and it is therefore likely that large areas of Amazonia exhibit significant seasonality in photosynthetic capacity. The gross primary production was calculated to be 30 t C ha-1 yr-1. An analysis of data quality is included in the appendix. ",

The carbon balance of forests is determined by a number of component processes of carbon acquisition and carbon loss, and a small shift in the magnitude of these processes would have a large impact on the global carbon cycle. In this paper, we discuss the climatic influences on the carbon dynamics of boreal, temperate and tropical forests by presenting a new synthesis of micrometeorological, ecophysiological and forestry data, concentrating on three case-study sites. Historical changes in the carbon balance of each biome are also reviewed, and the evidence for a carbon sink in each forest biome and its likely behaviour under future global change are discussed. We conclude that there have been significant advances in determining the carbon balance of forests, but there are still critical uncertainties remaining, particularly in the behaviour of soil carbon stocks.

However, these terms have only been studied at a handful of field sites, and with no consistent calculation methodology. Here we calculate above-ground coarse wood carbon productivity for 104 forest plots in lowland New World humid tropical forests, using a consistent calculation methodology that incorporates corrections for spatial variations in tree-size distributions and wood density, and for census interval length. Mean wood density is found to be lower in more productive forests. We estimate that above-ground coarse wood productivity varies by more than a factor of three (between 1.5 and 5.5 Mg C ha-1 a-1) across the Neotropical plots, with a mean value of 3.1 Mg C ha-1 a-1. There appear to be no obvious relationships between wood productivity and rainfall, dry season length or sunshine, but there is some hint of increased productivity at lower temperatures. There is, however, also strong evidence for a positive relationship between wood productivity and soil fertility. Fertile soils tend to become more common towards the Andes and at slightly higher than average elevations, so the apparent temperature/productivity relationship is probably not a direct one. Coarse wood productivity accounts for only a fraction of overall tropical forest net primary productivity, but the available data indicate that it is approximately proportional to total above-ground productivity. We speculate that the large variation in wood productivity is unlikely to directly imply an equivalent variation in gross primary production. Instead a shifting balance in carbon allocation between respiration, wood carbon and fine root production seems the more likely explanation. ",

We synthesise reported and unpublished results from three lowland rainforest sites in Amazonia (in the regions of Manaus, Tapajos and Caxiuano), all major sites of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Programme (LBA). We attempt a comprehensive synthesis of the C stocks, nutrient status and, particularly, the allocation and internal C dynamics of all three sites. The calculated net primary productivities (NPP) are 10.1Â±1.4 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (Manaus), 14.4Â±1.3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (Tapajos) and 10.0Â±1.2 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (Caxiuano). All errors bars report standard errors. Soil and leaf nutrient analyses indicate that Tapajos has significantly more plant-available phosphorus and calcium. Autotrophic respiration at all three sites (14.9-21.4 Mg C ha yr-1) is more challenging to measure, with the largest component and greatest source of uncertainty being leaf dark respiration. Comparison of measured soil respiration with that predicted from C cycling measurements provides an independent constraint. It shows general good agreement at all three sites, with perhaps some evidence for measured soil respiration being less than expected. Twenty to thirty percent of fixed C is allocated belowground. Comparison of gross primary productivity (GPP), derived from ecosystem flux measurements with that derived from component studies (NPP plus autotrophic respiration) provides an additional crosscheck. The two approaches are in good agreement, giving increased confidence in both approaches to estimating GPP. The ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEs), the ratio of NPP to GPP, is similar at Manaus (0.34Â±0.10) and Caxiuano (0.32Â±0.07), but may be higher at Tapajos (0.49Â±0.16), although the difference is not significant. Old growth or infertile tropical forests may have low CUE compared with recently disturbed and/or fertile forests. ",

Aims: We present the carbon budget of two forest plots in Tambopata in south-eastern Peru, western Amazonia. In particular, we present, for the first time, the seasonal variation in the detailed carbon budget of a tropical forest. Methods: We measured the major components of net primary production (NPP) and total autotrophic respiration over 3-6 years. Results: The NPP for the two plots was 15.1 Â± 0.8 and 14.2 Â± 1.0 Mg C ha-1 year-1, the gross primary productivity (GPP) was 35.5 Â± 3.6 and 34.5 Â± 3.5 Mg C ha-1 year-1, and the carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 0.42 Â± 0.05 and 0.41 Â± 0.05. NPP and CUE showed a large degree of seasonality. Conclusions: The two plots were similar in carbon cycling characteristics despite the different soils, the most notable difference being high allocation of NPP to canopy and low allocation to fine roots in the Holocene floodplain plot. The timing of the minima in the wet-dry transition suggests they are driven by phenological rhythms rather than being driven directly by water stress. When compared with results from forests on infertile forests in humid lowland eastern Amazonia, the plots have slightly higher GPP, but similar patterns of CUE and carbon allocation. ",

Economic drivers are now leading to the abandonment of agricultural lands, and the area in secondary forests is increasing. We know little about how long it takes for these ecosystems to achieve the structural and compositional characteristics of primary forests. In this study, we examine changes in plant species composition and aboveground biomass during eight decades of tropical secondary succession in Puerto Rico, and compare these patterns with primary forests. Using a well-replicated chronosequence approach, we sampled primary forests and secondary forests established 10, 20, 30, 60, and 80 years ago on abandoned pastures. Tree species composition in all secondary forests was different from that of primary forests and could be divided into early (10-, 20-, and 30-year) vs. late (60- and 80-year) successional phases. The highest rates of aboveground biomass accumulation occurred in the first 20 years, with rates of C sequestration peaking at 6.7 Â± 0.5 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1. Reforestation of pastures resulted in an accumulation of 125 Mg C/ha in aboveground standing live biomass over 80 years. The 80 year-old secondary forests had greater biomass than the primary forests, due to the replacement of woody species by palms in the primary forests. Our results show that these new ecosystems have different species composition, but similar species richness, and significant potential for carbon sequestration, compared to remnant primary forests.

Although soil temperature and moisture may be seasonally correlated, intra and inter-annual variations in soil moisture do occur. There are few direct observations of the influence of local variation in species composition or other stand/site characteristics on seasonal and annual variations in soil moisture, and on cumulative annual soil carbon release. Soil climate and soil respiration from twelve sites in five different forest types were monitored over a 2-year period (1998-1999). Also measured were stand age, species composition, basal area, litter inputs, total above-ground wood production, leaf area index, forest floor mass, coarse and fine root mass, forest floor carbon and nitrogen concentration, root carbon and nitrogen concentration, soil carbon and nitrogen concentration, coarse fraction mass and volume, and soil texture. General soil respiration models were developed using soil temperature, daily soil moisture, and various site/soil characteristics. Of the site/soil characteristics, above-ground production, soil texture, rootsÂ +Â forest floor mass, rootsÂ +Â forest floor carbon:nitrogen, and soil carbon:nitrogen were significant predictors of soil respiration when used alone in respiration models; all of these site variables were weakly to moderately correlated with mean site soil moisture. Daily soil climate data were used to estimate the annual release of carbon (C) from soil respiration for the period 1998-1999. Mean annual soil temperature did not differ between the 2Â years but mean annual soil moisture was approximately 9% lower in 1998 due to a summer drought. Soil C respired during 1998 ranged from 8.57 to 11.43Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â yr-1 while the same sites released 10.13 and 13.57Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â yr-1 in 1999; inter-annual differences of 15.41 and 15.73%, respectively. Among the 12 sites studied, we calculated that the depression of soil respiration linked to the drought caused annual differences of soil respiration from 11.00 to 15.78%. Annual estimates of respired soil C decreased with increasing site mean soil moisture. Similarly, the difference of respired carbon between the drought and the non-drought years generally decreased with increasing site mean soil moisture.",

We investigated the impact of stand age of cool temperate mountain ash forests (E. regnans) in Wallaby Creek, Victoria on carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere using a chronosequence of three sites of different ages (regrowth from bushfires in 1730, 1926 and 1983).

Litter fall and litter stocks were determined from July 1997 to March 1999 in four sites in central Amazonia: a primary rainforest, a 13-year-old secondary forest, and two sites of a polyculture forestry system which consisted of four planted tree species of commercial use amidst upcoming secondary growth. The average annual litter fall in the undisturbed primary rainforest (FLO) was 8.4 t ha-1 year-1, which is within the range of litter fall in other rainforests in the region. It was similar in one of the two polyculture sites (8.3 t ha-1 year-1), but lower in the secondary forest and in the second polyculture site. In the litter fall in secondary forest and agroforestry sites, the leaf portion was higher (76-82% of total litter fall) than in FLO, due to reduced fine matter and wood fall. Leaf litter fall variability was much lower in the plantation sites than in the forests, which is explained by the much more homogeneous stand structure of the plantations. The quality of the produced litter, measured as C/N ratio, differed significantly between the primary forest site and one polyculture and the secondary forest site. The cumulative input of nitrogen through litter fall was 144 kg ha-1 year-1 in FLO, and 91-112 kg ha-1 year-1 in the polycultures and the secondary forest. Litter fall was not correlated with soil parameters, but had a significant linear regression with canopy closure. For the primary rainforest, litter fall was also (inversely) correlated with monthly rainfall. Litter fall was higher in the first year (1997-1998; an El Nino period) than in 1998-1999. Litter stocks on the forest floor were highest in the secondary forest (24.7 t ha-1), and much lower in the polyculture sites (15.1-16.2 t ha-1) and the primary forest (12.0 t ha-1). There were no differences in the relative N content (C/N ratio) of the litter stocks between the sites, but the larger stocks led to higher absolute N contents in the litter layer in the secondary forest. From the monthly values of litter stocks (S) and litter fall (P), the decomposition coefficient k e=P/S was calculated, which was, on average, highest for the primary forest (0.059), followed by the polyculture systems (0.040-0.042), and by the secondary forest (0.024). Thus, due to low decomposition rates, the secondary forest site showed large litter accumulations in spite of a relatively low litter fall. In contrast, the primary forest showed high litter fall but low stocks, due to high decomposition rates. The decomposition coefficients of the polyculture systems ranged between the primary and the secondary forest. The reduced decomposition rates in the man-managed agroecosystems indicate quantitative and/or qualitative changes in the decomposer communities of these systems that lead to a higher build-up of litter stocks on the forest floor. However, the decomposer systems in the polyculture sites still were more functional than in the site of non-managed secondary growth. Thus, from a soil biological viewpoint, ecologically sustainable low-input agroforestry in Amazonia will benefit from the application of these polyculture systems.",

Carbon accumulates rapidly for the first 20Â years of succession, but few studies have considered forests older than 20Â years, and the available data do not yield a consistent pattern. Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed: (1) an asymptotic increase, with the highest carbon stocks occurring in the oldest stands, and (2) an intermediate peak, caused by roughly synchronous tree maturity (and thus high carbon stocks) after which time treefall gaps cause carbon stocks to regress. Here we revisited a well-studied tropical moist forest chronosequence in Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Central Panama, consisting of 35, 55, 85, and 115-year-old stands, as well as old-growth stands, to determine whether past evidence for the intermediate peak hypothesis was influenced by the spatial limitations of the field plots used to assess forest structure. We used airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to measure carbon stocks at the scale of the original transects (0.16Â ha), in surrounding forest of the same age (up to 20Â ha), and at a landscape scale incorporating thousands of hectares not previously measured. We also compared forest structure as measured in three dimensions by LiDAR, considering vertical and horizontal variation in canopy organization, as well as the abundance of treefall gaps. Our results suggested a strong scale-dependence of aboveground carbon accumulation, supporting the intermediate peak hypothesis at the fine scale of the 0.16-ha transects, but an asymptotic model at the landscape scale incorporating thousands of hectares. Further analyses of forest structure suggest that both the limitations of small plots and intrinsic scaling of forest structure and carbon dynamics account for the scale-dependence of aboveground carbon accumulation in this secondary forest matrix.",

Long-term effects can only be obtained from forests in which seasonal drought is a regular feature. We carried out measurements in a semiarid Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) forest of aboveground respiration rates of foliage, Rf, and stem, Rt over 3 years. Component respiration combined with ongoing biometric, net CO2 flux [net ecosystem productivity (NEP)] and soil respiration measurements were scaled to the ecosystem level to estimate gross and net primary productivity (GPP, NPP) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) using 6 years data. GPP, NPP and NEP were, on average, 880, 350 and 211 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively. The above ground respiration made up half of total ecosystem respiration but CUE remained high at 0.4. Large seasonal variations in both Rf and Rt were not consistently correlated with seasonal temperature trends. Seasonal adjustments of respiration were observed in both the normalized rate (R20) and short-term temperature sensitivity (Q10), resulting in low respiration rates during the hot, dry period. Rf in fully developed needles was highest over winter-spring, and foliage R20 was correlated with photosynthesis over the year. Needle growth occurred over summer, with respiration rates in developing needles higher than the fully developed foliage at most times. Rt showed a distinct seasonal maximum in May irrespective of year, which was not correlated to the winter stem growth, but could be associated with phenological drivers such as carbohydrate re-mobilization and cambial activity. We show that in a semiarid pine forest photosynthesis and stem growth peak in (wet) winter and leaf growth in (dry) summer, and associated adjustments of component respiration, dominated by those in R20, minimize annual respiratory losses. This is likely a key for maintaining high CUE and ecosystem productivity similar to much wetter sites, and could lead to different predictions of the effect of warming and drying climate on productivity of pine forests than based on short-term droughts.

Live fine root mass (LFR) showed less seasonal variation than dead fine root mass (DFR), which was correlated with seasonal changes in soil moisture and soil temperature. LFR mass increased significantly (by 86%) in the elevated CO2 treatment, with an increment of 37 g(dry weight) m-2 above the control plots after two years of CO2 fumigation. There was no long-term increment in DFR associated with elevated CO2, but significant seasonal accumulations of DFR mass occurred during the summer of the second year of fumigation. Overall, root net primary production (RNPP) was not significantly different, but annual carbon inputs were 21.7 gC m-2 y-1 (68%) higher in the elevated CO2 treatment compared to controls. Specific root respiration was not altered by the CO2 treatment during most of the year; however, it was significantly higher by 21% and 13% in September 1997 and May 1998, respectively, in elevated CO2. We did not find statistically significant differences in the C/N ratio of the root tissue, root decomposition or phosphatase activity in soil and roots associated with the treatment. Our data show that the early response of a loblolly pine forest ecosystem subject to CO2 enrichment is an increase in its fine root population and a trend towards higher total RNPP after two years of CO2 fumigation.

Although Fsoil is the dominant C flux following stand-replacing disturbance, the effects of catastrophic windthrow on Fsoil are still poorly understood. We measured Fsoil at a montane mixed-forest site and at a subalpine spruce forest site from 2009 until 2012. Each site consisted of an undisturbed forest stand and two adjacent partially cleared (stem-fraction-harvested) windthrow areas, which differed with regard to the time since disturbance. The combination of chronosequence and direct time-series approaches enabled us to investigate Fsoil dynamics over 12 years post-disturbance. At both sites Fsoil rates did not differ significantly from those of the undisturbed stands in the initial phase after disturbance (1-6 years). In the later phase after disturbance (9-12 years), Fsoil rates were significantly higher than in the corresponding undisturbed stand. Soil temperature increased significantly following windthrow (by 2.9-4.8 Â°C), especially in the initial phase post-disturbance when vegetation cover was sparse. A significant part (15-31%) of Fsoil from the windthrow areas was attributed to the increase in soil temperature. According to our estimates, ~500-700 g C m-2 year-1 are released via Fsoil from south-facing forest sites in the Austrian Calcareous Alps in the initial 6 years after windthrow. With a high browsing pressure suppressing tree regeneration, post-disturbance net loss of ecosystem C to the atmosphere is likely to be substantial unless forest management is proactive in regenerating such sites. An increase in the frequency of forest disturbance by windthrow could therefore decrease soil C stocks and feed back positively on rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. ",

Utilizing 10 yr of data from the Duke free-air CO2 enrichment site, we evaluated the dynamics and distribution of plant C. â€¢ Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations, resulting in higher (up to 50%) estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments. â€¢ Generally, elevated [CO2] caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C, but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools. Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its [CO2]-induced enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability, with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability. Consequently, [CO2]-induced net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30% in different plots and years. â€¢ Through quantifying the effects of nutrient and water availability on the forest productivity response to elevated [CO2], we show that net primary productivity enhancement by elevated [CO2] is not uniform, but rather highly dependent on the availability of other growth resources.

Measurements of energy, water vapour, and carbon dioxide fluxes have been made continuously since August 2003 using the eddy covariance technique, along with ancillary meteorological variables. The spatial structure of the site was evaluated using a variety of sources and techniques, including remote sensing, showing that this forest is mixed but relatively homogeneous. The canopy top height is remarkably constant at between 30 and 32Â m. The basal area varies from 18 to 27Â m2Â ha-1, and the aboveground biomass ranges from 82 to 122Â MgÂ ha-1. In this paper, we summarize the diurnal and seasonal patters of carbon dioxide exchange and water loss from September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is strongly related to temperature. Atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in this ecosystem exerted strong biophysical control on the daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and evapotranspiration. Seasonal change in shortwave albedo, as a result of the presence of mixed deciduous and coniferous species, was clearly evident. Albedo changes were comparable to the seasonal pattern of NEP. The dormant season lasts more than 6 months of the year at this station. This forest was a moderate sink of carbon over the measurement period. Annual values of GEP, ecosystem respiration (R), and NEP were 1075, 919, and 156Â Â±Â 35Â gÂ CÂ m-2, respectively.",

We surveyed the remaining old-growth forests on sites characteristic of the general Mid-Atlantic United States and estimated the size of multiple components of forest C storage. Within and between old-growth stands, variability in C density is high and related to overstory tree species composition. The sites contain 219 Â± 46 Mg C/ha (mean Â± SD), including live and dead aboveground biomass, leaf litter, and the soil O horizon, with over 20% stored in downed wood and snags. Stands dominated by tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) store the most live biomass, while the mixed oak (Quercus spp.) stands overall store more dead wood. Total C density is 30% higher (154 Mg C/ha), and dead wood C density is 1800% higher (46 Mg C/ha) in the old-growth forests than in the surrounding younger forests (120 and 5 Mg C/ha, respectively). The high density of dead wood in old growth relative to secondary forests reflects a stark difference in historical land use and, possibly, the legacy of the local disturbance (e.g., disease) history. Our results demonstrate the potential for dead wood to maintain the sink capacity of secondary forests for many decades to come. ",

In order to characterize how C cycling is shaped by tree size and drought adaptations and how these patterns relate to spatial and temporal variation in water deficit, we analyze data from three forest dynamics plots spanning a moisture gradient in Panama that have experienced El Niño droughts.
At all sites, aboveground C cycle contributions peaked below 50?cm stem diameter, with stems ? 50 cm accounting for on average 59% of live aboveground biomass, 45% of woody productivity and 49% of woody mortality. The dominance of drought?avoidance strategies increased interactively with stem diameter and dry season intensity. Although size?related C cycle contributions did not vary systematically across the moisture gradient under nondrought conditions, woody mortality of larger trees was disproportionately elevated under El Niño drought stress.
Thus, large (> 50 cm) stems, which strongly mediate but do not necessarily dominate C cycling, have drought adaptations that compensate for their more challenging hydraulic environment, particularly in drier climates. However, these adaptations do not fully buffer the effects of severe drought, and increased large tree mortality dominates ecosystem?level drought responses.",

Also through mineralization, cellulose and hot acid detergent soluble fraction decreased more rapidly than lignin. Lignin was apparently not lost until the later stages of decay, when N was also lost in significant amounts. This parallels the shift from initial dominance by white rots that degraded cellulose and lignin to later dominance by brown rots that preferentially degraded cellulose. Lignin and cellulose were eventually lost at more similar rates in later decay stages. This may have been due in part to a close association between the remaining cellulose and lignin in later decay stages. Lignin was a better predictor of the onset of N release than was the C:N ratio.",

In order to extrapolate from these measurements, we need to understand why carbon balance (or net ecosystem production, NEP) differs among forests. Here, we use a detailed model of forest carbon exchange applied to three coniferous European forests with differing NEP to pinpoint reasons for the differences among these sites. The model was parameterised using extensive ecophysiological data obtained at each site. These data gave evidence of major differences among sites in climate, leaf physiology, respiring biomass, leaf area index, and soil and biomass respiration rates. The model was compared with eddy covariance data and found to satisfactorily simulate carbon exchange by each forest. Simulations were then run which interchanged canopy structure, physiology and meteorology among sites, allowing us to quantify the contribution of each factor to the inter-site differences in gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and NEP. The most important factor was the difference in respiration rates, particularly soil respiration rates, among sites. Climate was also very important, with differences in incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) affecting GPP and differences in temperature affecting both GPP and RE. Effects of leaf area index, respiring biomass and leaf physiology on NEP were secondary, but still substantial. The work provides detailed quantitative evidence of the major factors causing differences in NEP among coniferous forests.",

The pasture and the forest were established in part of the cropland, respectively, 20 and 40 yr before the study began. Soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature, inorganic N and microbial C, as well as fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured in the plots over 25 months. The transformation of the cropland to mowed pasture slightly increased the soil organic and microbial C contents, whereas afforestation significantly increased these variables. The cropland and pasture soils showed low CH4 uptake rates (<1 kg CÂ ha-1Â yr-1) and, coinciding with WFPS values >70%, episodes of CH4 emission, which could be favoured by soil compaction. In the forest site, possibly because of the changes in soil structure and microbial activity, the soil always acted as a sink for CH4 (4.7 kg CÂ ha-1Â yr-1). The N2O releases at the cropland and pasture sites (2.7 and 4.8 kg N2O-NÂ ha-1Â yr-1) were, respectively, 3 and 6 times higher than at the forest site (0.8 kg N2O-NÂ ha-1Â yr-1). The highest N2O emissions in the cultivated soils were related to fertilisation and slurry application, and always occurred when the WFPS >60%. These results show that the changes in soil properties as a consequence of the transformation of cropfield to intensive grassland do not imply substantial changes in SOM or in the dynamics of CH4 and N2O. On the contrary, afforestation resulted in increases in SOM content and CH4 uptake, as well as decreases in N2O emissions.",

Estimated mean annual soil respiration varied between 13-17 t C ha-1 yr-1, which was partitioned into 0-2 t C ha-1 yr-1 from litter, 6-9 t C ha-1 yr-1 from roots, and 5-6 t C ha-1 yr-1 from soil organic matter. Litter contribution showed no clear seasonal change, though experimental precipitation exclusion over a one-hectare area was associated with a ten-fold reduction in litter respiration relative to unmodified sites. The estimated mean contribution of soil organic matter respiration fell from 49% during the wet season to 32% in the dry season, while root respiration contribution increased from 42% in the wet season to 61% during the dry season. Spatial variation in respiration from soil, litter, roots, and soil organic matter was not explained by volumetric soil moisture or temperature. Instead, spatial heterogeneity in litter and root mass accounted for 44% of observed spatial variation in soil respiration (p < 0.001). In particular, variation in litter respiration per unit mass and root mass accounted for much of the observed variation in respiration from litter and roots, respectively, and hence total soil respiration. This information about patterns of, and underlying controls on, respiration from different soil components should assist attempts to accurately model soil carbon dioxide fluxes over space and time.

The Amazon region may experience increasing moisture limitation over this century. Leaf dark respiration (R) is a key component of the Amazon rain forest carbon (C) cycle, but relatively little is known about its sensitivity to drought. 2. Here, we present measurements of R standardized to 25 Â°C and leaf morphology from different canopy heights over 5 years at a rain forest subject to a large-scale through-fall reduction (TFR) experiment, and nearby, unmodified Control forest, at the Caxiuano reserve in the eastern Amazon. 3. In all five post-treatment measurement campaigns, mean R at 25 Â°C was elevated in the TFR forest compared to the Control forest experiencing normal rainfall. After 5 years of the TFR treatment, R per unit leaf area and mass had increased by 65% and 42%, respectively, relative to pre-treatment means. In contrast, leaf area index (L) in the TFR forest was consistently lower than the Control, falling by 23% compared to the pre-treatment mean, largely because of a decline in specific leaf area (S). 4. The consistent and significant effects of the TFR treatment on R, L and S suggest that severe drought events in the Amazon, of the kind that may occur more frequently in future, could cause a substantial increase in canopy carbon dioxide emissions from this ecosystem to the atmosphere.

However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes after afforestation can be considerable, depending predominantly on site drainage and nutrient availability. Studies on the full GHG budget of afforested organic soils are scarce and hampered by the uncertainties associated with methodology. In this study we determined the GHG budget of a spruce-dominated forest on a drained organic soil with an agricultural history. Two different approaches for determining the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were applied, for the year 2008, one direct (eddy covariance) and the other indirect (analyzing the different components of the GHG budget), so that uncertainties in each method could be evaluated. The annual tree production in 2008 was 8.3 Â± 3.9 t C ha-1 yr-1 due to the high levels of soil nutrients, the favorable climatic conditions and the fact that the forest was probably in its phase of maximum C assimilation or shortly past it. The N2O fluxes were determined by the closed-chamber technique and amounted to 0.9 Â± 0.8 t Ceq ha-1 yr-1. According to the direct measurements from the eddy covariance technique, the site acts as a minor GHG sink of -1.2 Â± 0.8 t Ceq ha-1 yr-1. This contrasts with the NEE estimate derived from the indirect approach which suggests that the site is a net GHG emitter of 0.6 Â± 4.5 t Ceq ha-1 yr-1. Irrespective of the approach applied, the soil CO2 effluxes counter large amounts of the C sequestration by trees. Due to accumulated uncertainties involved in the indirect approach, the direct approach is considered the more reliable tool. As the rate of C sequestration will likely decrease with forest age, the site will probably become a GHG source once again as the trees do not compensate for the soil C and N losses. Also forests in younger age stages have been shown to have lower C assimilation rates; thus, the overall GHG sink potential of this afforested nutrient-rich organic soil is probably limited to the short period of maximum C assimilation.

In contrast to temperate trees, little information is available on such storage in tropical perennials, and almost none for Cocos nucifera. This paper describes the chemical nature, quantity and distribution of carbohydrate reserves in coconut plants grown in an environment favourable to production. The study was carried out on the island of Santo (Republic of Vanuatu, Southern Pacific) on twelve 17-year-old adult plants, representative of a large population, which were felled and characterized for root, trunk and crown dry matter, and contents of soluble sugars and starch. Roots were divided into three diameter classes and distal/proximal portions, the trunk into three axial and three or four radial zones, and the crown into petiole, rachis and leaflets for various leaf ages. The aggregate reserve pool size was compared with estimates of incremental demand for assimilates for growth and fruit production. Plants contained little starch but large quantities of sucrose were found, mainly located in the trunk. Less sucrose was present in roots and little in leaf blades. Large glucose and fructose pools were found in leaves, near the apex of the trunk and in the terminal portions of large roots. Aggregate soluble and non-soluble sugar pools were about equivalent to six months of copra production or 51 days of crop growth. More studies are needed on the dynamics of these sugars to evaluate their physiological role, particularly with regards to stress periods and fluctuating demand for fruit filling.",

We measured soil CO2 efflux (Rs) continuously from 2009 to 2010 in a lower coastal plain forested wetland in North Carolina, U.S., to characterize its main environmental drivers. To understand and quantify the spatial variation due to microtopography and associated differences in hydrology, measurements were conducted at three microsites along a microtopographic gradient. The seasonal hysteresis in Rs differed by microtopographic location and was caused by the transitions between flooded and nonflooded conditions. Because flooded Rs was small, we reported Rs dynamics mainly during nonflooded periods. A nested model, modified from conventional Q10 (temperature sensitivity) model with dynamic parameters, provided a significantly better simulation on the observed variation of Rs. The model performed better with daily data, indicating that soil temperature (Ts) and water table depth (WTD) were the primary drivers for seasonal variation. The diel variation of Rs was high and independent of Ts and WTD, which both had small diel variations, suggesting the likely association with plant activity. Overall, the site-average soil CO2 efflux was approximately 960-1103 g C m-2 yr-1 in 2010, of which 93% was released during nonflooded periods. Our study indicates that Rs is highly linked to hydroperiod and microtopography in forested wetlands and droughts in wetlands will accelerate soil C loss. ",

Biometric inventories indicated that the forest was either a source or, at most, a modest sink of carbon from 1984 to 2000 (+0.8 Â± 2 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1; a positive flux indicates carbon loss by the forest, a negative flux indicates carbon gain). Eddy covariance measurements of CO2 exchange were made from July 2000 to July 2001 using both open- and closed-path gas analyzers. The annual eddy covariance flux calculated without correcting for the underestimation of flux on calm nights indicated that the forest was a large carbon sink (-3.9 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1). This annual uptake is comparable to past reports from other Amazonian forests, which also were calculated without correcting for calm nights. The magnitude of the annual integral was relatively insensitive to the selection of open- versus closed-path gas analyzer, averaging time, detrending, and high-frequency correction. In contrast, the magnitude of the annual integral was highly sensitive to the treatment of calm nights, changing by over 4 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 when a filter was used to replace the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during nocturnal periods with u* < 0.2 m/s. Analyses of the relationship between nocturnal NEE and u* confirmed that the annual sum needs to be corrected for the effect of calm nights, which resulted in our best estimate of the annual flux (+0.4 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1). The observed sensitivity of the annual sum to the u* filter is far greater than has been previously reported for temperate and boreal forests. The annual carbon balance determined by eddy covariance is therefore less certain for tropical than temperate forests. Nonetheless, the biometric and micrometeorological measurements in tandem provide strong evidence that the forest was not a strong, persistent carbon sink during the study interval. ",

Fluxes were measured by eddy covariance using conventional techniques. In all years examined (1998-2000), the forest was a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere. However, the magnitude of this inferred source depended upon assumptions regarding the degree of â€œfluxâ€ loss under conditions of low turbulence, such as typically occur at night. When corrections were not made, the forest was calculated to be only a modest source of C to the atmosphere (3-5 mol C m-2 yr-1). However, when the corrections were included, the apparent source was much larger (20-30 mol C m-2 yr-1). Using a simple model to describe the temperature dependencies of ecosystem respiration on air and soil temperatures, about 80% of the night-time flux was inferred to be from soil respiration, with the remainder being attributable to foliage, branches and boles. We used reasonable assumptions to estimate the rate of ecosystem respiration during the day, allowing an estimation of canopy photosynthetic rates and hence the annual Gross Primary Productivity of the ecosystem. For the two full years examined (1999 and 2000), this was estimated at 122 and 130 mol C m-2 yr-1, respectively. This value is similar to estimates for boreal forests in Scandinavia, but substantially higher than has been reported for Canadian or Siberian boreal forests. There was a clear tendency for canopy photosynthetic rates to increase with both light and temperature, but the slope of the temperature response of photosynthesis was less steep that that of ecosystem respiration. Thus, on most warm days in summer the forest was a substantial source of carbon to the atmosphere; with the forest usually being a net sink only on high insolation days where the average daily air temperatures were below about 18 Â°C. These data, along with other studies on the current balance of boreal ecosystems, suggests that at the current time many boreal forests might be releasing substantial amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This observed temperature sensitivity of this ecosystem suggests that this might be a consequence of substantially higher than average temperatures over recent years.xs",

Thinning in spring 2000 decreased the leaf area index (LAI) by 34% and added 496Â g CÂ m-2 of wood and leaf debris at the soil surface. Total ecosystem respiration was not significantly affected by thinning (1261Â g CÂ m-2 in 1999 and 1273Â g CÂ m-2 in 2000), while canopy photosynthesis decreased by 202Â g CÂ m-2.

Woody and leaf debris resulting from thinning only accounted for maximum 1% and 7% of the total respiration flux, respectively. Thinning did not affect the relative proportion of the different components of respiration to an observable degree. Low soil water availability in summer 2001 and 2002 decreased the proportion of soil respiration to the total respiration. It also imposed limitations on canopy photosynthesis: as a result the ecosystem shifted from a sink to a source of carbon 1 month earlier than in a wetter year (1999). The leaf area index and biomass of the stand increased rapidly after the thinning. The ecosystem was again a sink of carbon in 2001 (-97Â g CÂ m-2) and 2002 (-172Â g CÂ m-2). The net carbon uptake outside the traditionally-defined growing season can be important in this ecosystem (NEEÂ =Â -50Â g CÂ m-2 in 2000), but interannual variations are significant due to differences in winter temperatures.",

In 2003, a 27% throughfall exclusion experiment was installed in a Quercus ilex L. forest in France. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were estimated in a control and a dry treatment. Decreasing throughfall decreased GPP by 14% and had a smaller effect on RECO (-12%), especially soil respiration RS (-11%). Interannual variability of GPP (29%) was higher than for RECO (12%). Error propagation was used to estimates uncertainties in the NEE fluxes, which ranged from 3% to 10% in the control treatment but up to 167% for NEE in the dry treatment because more steps and data types were involved in the scaling. After 3 years of throughfall exclusion, we found no acclimation of RS to climatic drivers. Functional properties of the response of RS to soil water, temperature and rain pulse remained similar in the control and the dry treatments. A diurnal clockwise hysteresis in RS was probably controlled by canopy photosynthesis with a 3 h lag. The proportion of diurnal variation of respiration due to photosynthesis was similar in all treatments (4-5%). Because of the characteristic of rain in Mediterranean climates, a continuous decrease of water input in these environments have an effect on topsoil water and consequently on RS only during short periods when rainfall is characterized by infrequent and small events that does not allow the topsoil to reach field capacity and does not allow to dry completely. However, in the longer term, we expect a stronger decrease in RS in the dry treatment driven by the decrease in GPP. ",

The study site experienced a severe drought in 1997-1998 associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation event. The drought effect on heath forest productivity was also assessed by evaluating changes in wood mass increment rates. Allometric relationships suggested that heath forest trees had leaves with smaller specific leaf area (SLA), and large heath forest trees allocate more to leaf mass compared to mixed dipterocarp forest trees. Aboveground biomass (for trees = 4.8 cm DBH) in two 1-ha plots, P1 and P4, totaled 244.8 and 232.0 Mg/ha. Aboveground wood mass increment rate was -0.1 and 4.7 Mg/ha/yr in P1 and P4 during the drought period (from February to August 1998), while it quickly recovered to 8.1 and 8.5 Mg/ha/yr during the post-drought period (from August 1998 to August 1999 for P1 and from August 1998 to November 1999 for P4). This suggests a severe impact of the drought on heath forest productivity. Leaf characteristics of heath forest such as small SLA and long-lived leaves probably play a significant role in effective assimilation and maintenance of heath forest productivity under stressful conditions.

HJP02 had the weakest responses, followed by HJP94. This apparent greater ecosystem activity at the burned sites is likely caused by local differences in soil moisture and nutrients, differences in vegetation development, and differences in the decomposition of coarse woody debris.",

The objective was to test the hypothesis that N addition would reduce soil respiration in N saturated tropical forests. Static chamber and gas chromatography techniques were used to quantify the soil respiration, following four-levels of N treatments (Control, no N addition; Low-N, 5 g N m-2 yr-1; Medium-N, 10 g N m-2 yr-1; and High-N, 15 g N m-2 yr-1 experimental inputs), which had been applied for 26 months before and continued throughout the respiration measurement period. Results showed that soil respiration exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with the highest rates found in the warm and wet growing season (April-September) and the lowest rates in the dry dormant season (December-February). Soil respiration rates showed a significant positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, whereas soil moisture only affect soil respiration at dry conditions in the dormant season. Annual accumulative soil respiration was 601Â±30 g CO2-C m-2 yr-1 in the Controls. Annual mean soil respiration rate in the Control, Low-N and Medium-N treatments (69Â±3, 72Â±3 and 63Â±1 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, respectively) did not differ significantly, whereas it was 14% lower in the High-N treatment (58Â±3 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1) compared with the Control treatment, also the temperature sensitivity of respiration, Q10 was reduced from 2.6 in the Control with 2.2 in the High-N treatment. The decrease in soil respiration occurred in the warm and wet growing season and were correlated with a decrease in soil microbial activities and in fine root biomass in the N-treated plots. Our results suggest that response of soil respiration to atmospheric N deposition in tropical forests is a decline, but it may vary depending on the rate of N deposition. ",

Considering respiration as a function of microbial population a regression analysis was made. The microfungal population showed positive relationship with the rate of soil respiration. The study revealed that conversion of natural forest led to a reduction of soil microbes and rate of soil respiration. Considering the importance of the microbial component in soil, we conclude that the conversion of natural forests to different land uses leads to the loss of biological stability of the soil.",

As well as drainage, forest management such as fertilizer application can affect these pools. We studied the effect of wood ash (application rates 0, 5 and 15 t ha-1) on the heterotrophic soil respiration (CO2 efflux), cellulose decomposition, soil nutrients, biomass production and amount of C accumulated in a tree stand on a pine-dominated drained mire in central Finland. The ash was spread 13 years before the respiration measurements. The annual CO2 efflux was statistically modelled using soil temperature as the driving variable. Wood ash application increased the amounts of mineral nutrients of peat substantially and increased soil pH in the uppermost 10 cm layer by 1.5-2 pH units. In the surface peat, the decomposition rate of cellulose in the ash plots was roughly double that in control plots. Annual CO2 efflux was least on the unfertilized site, 238 g CO2-C m-2 year-1. The use of wood ash nearly doubled CO2 efflux to 420-475 g CO2-Cm-2 year-1 on plots fertilized with 5-15 t ha-1 of ash, respectively. Furthermore, ash treatments resulted also in increased stand growth, and during the measurement year, the growing stand on ash plots accumulated carbon 11-12 times faster than the control plot. The difference between peat C emission and amount of C sequestered by trees on the ash plots was 43-58 g C m-2, while on the control plot it was 204 g C m-2. Our conclusion is that adding wood ash as a fertilizer increases more C sequestration in the tree stand than C efflux from the peat. ",

Annual carbon sequestration for the forest was 6.71 mol C m-2 (80.5 g C m-2) for the year between November 1, 1998 and October 31, 1999, and 4.80 mol C m-2 (57.6 g C m-2) for the year between November 1, 1999 and October 31, 2000. Despite its evergreen nature, the forest did not exhibit net CO2 uptake during the winter, even during periods of favourable weather. The largest fraction of annual carbon sequestration occurred in the early growing-season; during the first 30 days of both years. Reductions in the rate of carbon sequestration after the first 30 days were due to higher ecosystem respiration rates when mid-summer moisture was adequate (as in the first year of the study) or lower mid-day photosynthesis rates when mid-summer moisture was not adequate (as in the second year of the study). The lower annual rate of carbon sequestration during the second year of the study was due to lower rates of CO2 uptake during both the first 30 days of the growing season and the mid-summer months. The reduction in CO2 uptake during the first 30 days of the second year was due to an earlier-than-normal spring warm-up, which caused snow melt during a period when air temperatures were lower and atmospheric vapour pressure deficits were higher, compared to the first 30 days of the first year. The reduction in CO2 uptake during the mid-summer of the second year was due to an extended drought, which was accompanied by reduced latent heat exchange and increased sensible heat exchange. Day-to-day variation in the daily integrated NEE during the summers of both years was high, and was correlated with frequent convective storm clouds and concomitant variation in the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Carbon sequestration rates were highest when some cloud cover was present, which tended to diffuse the photosynthetic photon flux, compared to periods with completely clear weather. The results of this study are in contrast to those of other studies that have reported increased annual NEE during years with earlier-than-normal spring warming. In the current study, the lower annual NEE during 2000, the year with the earlier spring warm-up, was due to (1) coupling of the highest seasonal rates of carbon sequestration to the spring climate, rather than the summer climate as in other forest ecosystems that have been studied, and (2) delivery of snow melt water to the soil when the spring climate was cooler and the atmosphere drier than in years with a later spring warm-up. Furthermore, the strong influence of mid-summer precipitation on CO2 uptake rates make it clear that water supplied by the spring snow melt is a seasonally limited resource, and summer rains are critical for sustaining high rates of annual carbon sequestration.

Above-ground biomass, nutrient concentration of above-ground tree tissues, and soil nutrients were examined in two young plantations of eight indigenous tree species grown in pure and mixed designs in a low fertility site in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica. The goal was to assess the role of nutrient accumulation in above-ground biomass on potential site nutrient decline, and to draw recommendations to conserve site nutrients in the long term.In Plantation 1, Jacaranda copaia pure stands had higher above-ground tree N, P, and Mg than the other treatments, while Vochysia guatemalensis had the greatest accumulation of K and Ca. For J. copaia, stem harvest would remove about 54% of total above-ground tree N, but about 80% of P, K, Ca and Mg. For V. guatemalensis, stem harvest would remove less than 30% of N but from 50 to 60% of total above-ground tree Ca, K, Mg and P. Branches and foliage summed together were 25 to 35% of total above-ground tree biomass, but they generally represented about 50% of above-ground tree nutrients. In Plantation 2, the mixed stands had the highest above-ground nutrient content for all nutrients, and both the mixture and Terminalia amazonia pure stands had the highest stem P and Mg.Five years after planting, decreases in soil P, K and Ca were apparent in pure plots of the fastest growing species with the largest accumulation of nutrients in above-ground biomass, such as J. copaia and V. guatemalensis. However, in other cases, beneficial effects on some soil nutrients were noted: for example, increases in soil Ca under T. amazonia and Virola koschnyi, both species with high Ca content in foliage and high rates of annual litterfall. The mixed plots showed intermediate values for the nutrients examined, and even improved soil conditions, as for P in Plantation 1. This suggests that in mixed conditions it may take longer to deplete soil nutrients than in monospecific stands of fast-growing species.Results of continued sampling will be needed to assess the long term effects of plantation treatments on soil chemistry, especially near the end of the rotation (estimated at 12-15 years, depending on the species). The calculation of whole-stand nutrient budgets can help in the selection of tree species and plantation management strategies to favor nutrient recycling mechanisms and site nutrient conservation.",

A study was undertaken to investigate both factors on two sites under tropical heath forest (Badas Forest Reserve) and mixed-dipterocarp forest (Andulau Forest Reserve) in Brunei. Soil water potentials were monitored at depths of 20, 50, and 90 cm over wet and dry periods for five months at each site. The results showed the mixed-dipterocarp forest site to be drier at 50 cm depth compared to the tropical heath forest site. There was no significant difference in water potentials between sites at 20 or 90 cm. Nutrient concentrations in the soil solution were monitored at the same depths over a seven-month period at the same sites. A 12-month litterfall study was also undertaken to monitor nutrient returns from the canopy at each site. The results of both studies suggest that the tropical heath forest site is poorer in nitrogen, but richer in calcium, than the mixed-dipterocarp forest site. The results for phosphorus are less clear, but do not suggest that its limitation is a significant factor at the tropical heath forest site compared to the mixed-dipterocarp forest site. Phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in the soil solution showed a strong positive correlation with sliding 30-day rainfall totals at both sites. ",

This period included the El Nino/La Nina cycle during the northern hemispheric winters of 1997/1998 and 1998/1999, offering a unique opportunity to study how a typical forest ecosystem in the Pacific Northwest reacts to interannual climate variability. This was possible even though annual FNEP values calculated from eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CO2 fluxes were subject to biases. These were largely due to the failure of the EC method to accurately measure losses of CO2 under low turbulence conditions at night, which caused FNEP overestimates of as much as 90Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year. As these biases were largely unaffected by interannual climate variability, it was possible to reliably quantify interannual differences in FNEP estimates if they were larger than random variability, which was estimated to be Â±30Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year at most. Interannual differences were mainly due to differences in ecosystem respiration (R) between the 4 years. In the year following the 1997/1998 El Nino, high air temperatures led to the highest annual R of the 4 years, while annual gross ecosystem photosynthesis (P) was only slightly higher than normal. This resulted in 1998 having the lowest FNEP (270Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year) of the 4 years. For 1999, a cool and cloudy La Nina year, FNEP was 360Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year, much higher than 1998, but somewhat lower than the last 2 years, for which FNEP values were 390 and 420Â gÂ CÂ m-2 per year, respectively.",

Tropical forests are thought to have comparably high LAIs; however, precise data are scarce and environmental controls of leaf area in tropical forests are not understood. We studied LAI and stand leaf biomass by optical and leaf mass-related approaches in five tropical montane forests along an elevational transect (1,050-3,060Â m a.s.l.) in South Ecuador, and conducted a meta-analysis of LAI and leaf biomass data from tropical montane forests around the globe. Study aims were (1) to assess the applicability of indirect and direct approaches of LAI determination in tropical montane forests, (2) to analyze elevation effects on leaf area, leaf mass, SLA, and leaf lifespan, and (3) to assess the possible consequences of leaf area change with elevation for montane forest productivity. Indirect optical methods of LAI determination appeared to be less reliable in the complex canopies than direct leaf mass-related approaches based on litter trapping and a thorough analysis of leaf lifespan. LAI decreased by 40-60% between 1,000 and 3,000Â m in the Ecuador transect and also in the pan-tropical data set. This decrease indicates that canopy carbon gain, that is, carbon source strength, decreases with elevation in tropical montane forests. Average SLA decreased from 88 to 61Â cm2Â g-1 whereas leaf lifespan increased from 16 to 25Â mo between 1,050 and 3,060Â m in the Ecuador transect. In contrast, stand leaf biomass was much less influenced by elevation. We conclude that elevation has a large influence not only on the leaf traits of trees but also on the LAI of tropical montane forests with soil N (nitrogen) supply presumably being the main controlling factor.",

In an altitudinal transect study in the South Ecuadorian Andes, we tested the hypotheses that (i) aboveground net primary production (ANPP) decreases continuously with elevation due to decreasing temperatures, whereas (ii) belowground productivity (BNPP) remains constant or even increases with elevation due to a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. In five tropical mountain forests between 1050 and 3060 m a.s.l., we investigated all major above- and belowground biomass and productivity components, and the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC). Leaf biomass, stemwood mass and total aboveground biomass (AGB) decreased by 50% to 70%, ANPP by about 70% between 1050 and 3060 m, while stem wood production decreased 20-fold. Coarse and large root biomass increased slightly, fine root biomass fourfold, while fine root production (minirhizotron study) roughly doubled between 1050 and 3060 m. The total tree biomass (above- and belowground) decreased from about 320 to 175 Mg dry mass ha-1, total NPP from ca. 13.0 to 8.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1. The belowground/aboveground ratio of biomass and productivity increased with elevation indicating a shift from light to nutrient limitation of tree growth. We propose that, with increasing elevation, an increasing nitrogen limitation combined with decreasing temperatures causes a large reduction in stand leaf area resulting in a substantial reduction of canopy carbon gain toward the alpine tree line. We conclude that the marked decrease in tree height, AGB and ANPP with elevation in these mountain forests is caused by both a belowground shift of C allocation and a reduction in C source strength, while a temperature-induced reduction in C sink strength (lowered meristematic activity) seems to be of secondary importance.

On three manipulation plots we excluded summer throughfall in the years of 2006/2007 and measured SR fluxes in comparison to three control plots. Using radiocarbon measurements we quantified the contribution of rhizosphere (RR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to total SR. In both manipulation years, mean CO2 emissions (Â±SE) from the throughfall exclusion (TE) plots were smaller than from the control plots with 5.7 t C ha-1 (Â±0.3) compared to 6.7 t C ha-1 (Â±0.2) in 2006 and 5.9 t C ha-1 (Â±0.3) compared to 7.0 t C ha-1 (Â±0.4) in 2007. Under control conditions, CO2 originated mainly from HR (60-95% of SR). Prolonged drought reduced HR, whereas RR was not affected or even increased slightly. Reduction of CO2 emissions on the TE plots was found up to 6 weeks after differences in matric potential conditions disappeared, possibly either because water repellency inhibited homogeneous rewetting of the organic horizons or because of severe damage to the microbial population. No evidence was found for the release of new, formerly protected substrates by preceding drought. Continuous measurements in 2008 (no manipulation) did not reveal increased CO2 emissions on the TE plots that could compensate for the reduction during the years 2006/2007. Based on our results, we postulate a negative feedback between increased frequency and magnitude of summer droughts and SR in Norway spruce stands. ",

In this study, we induced mild soil frost (up to -5 Â°C in a depth of 5 cm below surface) in a Norway spruce forest soil by removing the natural snow cover in the winter of 2005/2006. Soil frost lasted from January to April 2006 and was detected down to 15 cm depth. Soil frost effectively reduced soil respiration in the snow removal plots in comparison to undisturbed control plots. On an annual basis 6.2 t C ha-1 a-1 were emitted in the control plots compared with 5.1 t C ha-1 a-1 in the snow removal plots. Only 14% of this difference was attributed to reduced soil respiration during the soil frost period itself, whereas 63% of this difference originated from differences during the summer of 2006. Radiocarbon (<U+0394>14C) signature of CO2 revealed a considerable reduction of heterotrophic respiration on the snow removal plots, only partly compensated for by a slight increase of rhizosphere respiration. Similar CO2 concentrations in the uppermost mineral horizons of both treatments indicate that differences between the treatments originated from the organic horizons. Extremely low water contents between June and October of 2006 may have inhibited the recovery of the heterotrophic organisms from the frost period, thereby enhancing the differences between the control and snow removal plots. We conclude that soil frost triggered a change in the composition of the microbial community, leading to an increased sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to summer drought. A CO2 pulse during thawing, such as described for arable soils several times throughout the literature, with the potential to partly compensate for reduced soil respiration during soil frost, appears to be lacking for this soil. Our results from this experiment indicate that soil frost reduces C emission from forest soils, whereas mild winters may enhance C losses from forest soils. ",

In this study, we reconstruct the history of tree growth and quantify the standing biomass along a chronosequence of six Norway spruce stands (Picea abies [L.] Karst; 16-142 years old) on acid soils in a mountainous region with high nitrogen deposition. The inventories of the study sites, as well as the historical stem growth of the sample trees were compared with common yield tables, representing growing conditions before 1960, to find out if and when significant changes in growth of trees had occurred. The growth at tree level (0.003-0.030Â m3Â yr-1) was about 150-350% higher than predicted by the yield tables, independent of tree age. Because of low stand densities due to early thinning, the increase of stem growth at stand level (90% higher than yield table predictions) and the stand volume (35% higher than yield table predictions) were not as high as the increase of growth at tree level. Total biomass at stand level (including stems, branches, twigs, needles and roots) ranged between 35 and 180Â tÂ CÂ ha-1. Net primary productivity varied between 6 and 13Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â yr-1. Intensive tree thinning activities probably stimulated growth of remaining trees, but the observed growth rates were beyond what would be expected from these activities exclusively. Thus it is assumed that the fertilisation effects of increased nitrogen deposition and CO2 concentration, and improved climatic conditions due to ongoing climate change, have contributed to the observed changes in stem growth and that the thinning activities were synergetic with changing environmental conditions. The implications for carbon sinks as accountable under the Kyoto Protocol are probably small, because changes in environmental conditions are not accountable under the Kyoto Protocol and most of the observed changes in growth took place before 1990, the baseline for the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, it is assumed that impacts on the carbon balance of forest stands due to changes in the thinning regime after 1990, which would be accountable according to article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, are very small without any synergetic changes in environmental conditions.",

Changes in CO2 storage under the eddy-flux measurement level were quantified using vertical profiles of the CO2 concentration. Seasonal variations in net CO2 exchange between the forest and the atmosphere are discussed in terms of both phenological developments of the forest canopy and micrometeorological variables. To estimate the annual exchange of CO2, the net CO2 exchange data both during periods of poor turbulence and during periods of missing data were replaced by simple parametric models based on measurements of soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation. The corrected annual carbon sequestration estimate was 260 g C m-2. The estimates of annual gross carbon gain and loss at the forest were 1120 and 860 g C m-2.",

Information on the carbon budget is still limited for this Siberian larch taiga in comparison to boreal forests in other regions, while the larch forests are expected to play a key role in the global carbon balance due to their wide distribution over North-East Eurasia. The authors reported results of eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements at a mature Gmelin larch stand in Central Siberia, Russia (64Â°16'N, 100Â°12'E, 250 m a.s.l.). The measurements were conducted during one growing season (June-early September in 2004). CO2 uptake was initiated in early June and increased sharply until late June, which was closely related to the phenology of the larch trees (i.e., bud-break and needle flush). Maximum half-hourly net CO2 uptake was ~6 Âµmol m-2 s-1. Maximum daily net uptake of ~2 g C m-2 day-1 occurred at the end of June and in mid-July. Cumulative net uptake was 76-78 g C m-2, indicating that the mature larch forest acted as a net sink for CO2 during the growing season (91 days). In comparison with other boreal forests, however, the magnitude of net CO2 uptake and night-time release of the forest, and cumulative net CO2 uptake were lower. We suggest that lower net ecosystem CO2 uptake of the study stand was primarily associated with low leaf area index.",

The carbon flow (litterfall, soil respiration, etc.) rates were larger on the foot-slope than on the mid-slope, but there was no significant difference of the accumulation of soil carbon (A0 layer or human in mineral soil) between the areas. The results of the analysis of soil carbon cycling based on a compartment model show that the relative decomposition rate of A0 layer and humaus in mineral soil increased 1.4-1.5 fold from the mid- to the foot-slopes, corresponding to the soil moisture condition. The relative decomposition rate of A0 layer was, however, about one-third of that in a evergreen oak forest. This fact suggests that the great resistance of needle litter to decomposition is one of the main limiting factors of the cycling of soil carbon and prevents the fertilization of mineral soil in the pine forest, which was also proven by the simulation of dynamics of soil carbon cycling.",

Amida, Hiroshima Prefecture, west Japan, and analyzed by a compartment model. The results observed and analyzed were compared with those obtained by the same methods in natural secondary (Japanese red pine) and climax (evergreen oak) forests developed in the same warm-temperate zone, west Japan. There was no clear seasonal trend in litterfall rate and accumulation of A0 layer, but soil respiration increased in summer and decreased in winter with the change in soil surface temperature. The relative decomposition rate of the A0 layer (0.187 year-1) observed in the cedar plantation was one-third of that in an evergreen oak forest and rather less than in a Japanese red pine forest. Transfer of humus from the A0 layer to mineral soil was faster than in the pine forest, and thus the loss rate of the A0 layer (0.262 year-1) was somewhat larger than that in the pine forest. However, the relative decomposition rate of humus in mineral soil (0.0063 year-1) was only one-third of those in the pine and evergreen oak forests. This suggests that soil carbon cycling was extremely slow in the cedar plantation. This is probably due to the great resistance of cedar litter to decomposition and to less broadleaf litterfall than in the pine forest, because the soil environmental conditions were no worse than in other two forests. Based on these results, a discussion is presented on the management of cedar plantations, how to maintain their productivity under conditions with slow material cycling and how to enhance this cycling.",

Leaf N, P, and Ca concentrations as well the leaf N isotope ratios (d15N) from a large set of legume and non-legume tree species were measured. Legumes had higher foliar N/Ca ratios than non-legumes, consistent with the high energetic costs in plant growth associated with higher foliar P/Ca ratios found in legumes than in non-legumes. At the regional level, foliar d15N decreased with increasing rainfall. At the landscape level, N availability was higher in the forests on clayey soils on the plateau than in forests on sandier soils. The isotope as well as the non-isotope data relationships here documented, explain to a large extent the variation in d15N signatures across gradients of rainfall and soil. Although at the regional level, the precipitation regime is a major determinant of differences in N availability, at the landscape level, under the same precipitation regime, soil type seems to be a major factor influencing the availability of N in the Brazilian Amazon forest.",

We quantified total aboveground dry biomass (TAGB) in undisturbed central Amazonian rainforests, based on detailed estimates of all live and dead plant material within 20 1Â ha plots spanning an extensive (ca. 1000Â km2) study area. TAGB values in our study area were very high, averaging 397.7Â±30.0Mgha-1. The most important component of aboveground biomass was large (=10Â cm diameter-at-breast-height (DBH)) trees, which comprised 81.9% of TAGB, followed by downed wood debris (7.0%), small trees, saplings, and seedlings (<10Â cm DBH; 5.3%), lianas (2.1%), litter (1.9%), snags (1.5%), and stemless palms (0.3%). Among large trees, aboveground biomass was greatest in intermediate-sized (20-50Â cm DBH) stems (46.7% of TAGB), with very large (=60Â cm DBH) trees also containing substantial biomass (13.4% of TAGB). There were no significant correlations between large tree biomass and that of any other live or dead biomass component. An analysis based on the variability of our samples suggested that just 3-4 randomly positioned 1Â ha plots would be sufficient to provide a reasonable estimate of mean TAGB in a landscape such as ours (with 95% confidence intervals being <10% of the mean). This suggests that efforts to quantify Amazon forest biomass should be extensive rather than intensive; researchers should sample many geographically separate areas with a few plots each, rather than sampling a small number of areas more intensively.",

The remaining forests hold many endangered species but are threatened by the heavy local demand for fuelwood. Here we evaluate fallow land in western Uganda as an alternate fuel source to diverse forests. We quantify the regeneration process on fallows, calculate tree bio-mass increases, and measure grass and woody herb biomass over 44 months. The biomass values we measured were typical or slightly below the average from 11 studies elsewhere in the tropics. Variation in biomass between our neighboring study sites exceeded that between sites on different continents, indicating the sensitivity of vegetation regeneration to local land use. Tree regeneration was extremely slow (0.46 g/m2/year); however, the woody herbs and grasses on a 4 year old fallow of ~0.5 ha can provide much of a family's domestic fuel. Fallow land is generally abundant in western Uganda and can partially alleviate pressure on forests for domestic fuels. Fallows cannot however provide the trees demanded by charcoal, brick, and gin manufacturers. In the future, conserving forests while meeting fuelwood demands will require improving local land tenure security, enhancing the productivity of cultivated and abandoned land, promoting more efficient stoves, stills and kilns, and curtailing illicit, inefficient charcoal manufacture.

Net primary production of the vegetative compartments of the trees accumulated steadily throughout the year. Fruits accounted for 46% of tree NPP and showed large seasonal variations. On an annual basis, the sum of estimated NPP (16.1 Mg C ha-1 year-1) and Ra (24.0 Mg C ha-1 year-1) for the ecosystem (coconut trees and herbaceous understory) closely matched GPP (39.0 Mg C ha-1 year-1), suggesting adequate cross-validation of annual C budget methods. However, seasonal variations in NPP + Ra were smaller than the seasonal variations in GPP, and maximum tree NPP occurred 6 months after the midsummer peak in GPP and solar radiation. We propose that this discrepancy reflects seasonal variation in the allocation of dry mass to carbon reserves and new plant tissue, thus affecting the allometric relationships used for estimating NPP.",

Species-specific and mixed-species regressions for estimating total above-ground dry weight (DW) were therefore developed using eight abundant secondary forest tree species in the central Amazon. Using only DBH as the input variable, the species-specific equations estimated DW of individual trees with an average error of 10-15%. For the mixed-species equations, developed using 132 trees from seven of the eight species (excluding Cecropia), average error in estimating DW of individual trees was 19.8% using only DBH and 15.0% using DBH plus specific density of the wood (SD). Average SD for each species can be substituted without increasing the error of the estimate. Adding total tree height (H) as an input variable provided only a slight reduction in error to 14.0%. Previously published mixed-species biomass regression models, based on primary and secondary forest trees of the Amazon, were also cross-validated against the trees of this study. Two of these models, based on primary forest plots and using only DBH as an input, overestimated biomass by 10-60% for central Amazonian secondary forest trees in the size range 5-25Â cm. The overestimate was greatest for the larger trees. Including Cecropia in the test group will make the overestimate even greater. Those published equations using DBH, H and SD as inputs, whether from secondary or primary forest plots, showed better agreement with the sample-derived regressions and lower average errors in estimation of individual tree dry weights.",

Journal of Geophysical Research, 107(D20). doi:10.1029/2001jd000360",English,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001JD000360,"Moist tropical forests in Amazonia and elsewhere are subjected to increasingly severe drought episodes through the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and possibly through deforestation-driven reductions in rainfall. The effects of this trend on tropical forest canopy dynamics, emissions of greenhouse gases, and other ecological functions are potentially large but poorly understood. We established a throughfall exclusion experiment in an east-central Amazon forest (Tapajos National Forest, Brazil) to help understand these effects. After 1-year intercalibration period of two 1-ha forest plots, we installed plastic panels and wooden gutters in the understory of one of the plots, thereby excluding ~890 mm of throughfall during the exclusion period of 2000 (late January to early August) and ~680 mm thus far in the exclusion period of 2001 (early January to late May). Average daily throughfall reaching the soil during the exclusion period in 2000 was 4.9 and 8.3 mm in the treatment and control plots and was 4.8 and 8.1 mm in 2001, respectively. During the first exclusion period, surface soil water content (0-2 m) declined by ~100 mm, while deep soil water (2-11 m) was unaffected. During the second exclusion period, which began shortly after the dry season when soil water content was low, surface and deep soil water content declined by ~140 and 160 mm, respectively. Although this depletion of soil water provoked no detectable increase in leaf drought stress (i.e., no reduction in predawn leaf water potential), photosynthetic capacity declined for some species, the canopy thinned (greater canopy openness and lower leaf area index) during the second exclusion period, stem radial growth of trees <15 m tall declined, and fine litterfall declined in the treatment plot, as did tree fruiting. Aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) (stemwood increment and fine litter production) declined by one fourth, from 15.1 to 11.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1, in the treatment plot and decreased slightly, from 11.9 to 11.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1, in the control plot. Stem respiration varied seasonally and was correlated with stem radial growth but showed no treatment response. The fastest response to the throughfall exclusion, and the surface soil moisture deficits that it provoked, was found in the soil itself. The treatment reduced N2O emissions and increased CH4 consumption relative to the control plot, presumably in response to the improved soil aeration that is associated with soil drying. Our hypothesis that NO emissions would increase following exclusion was not supported. The conductivity and alkalinity of water percolating through the litter layer and through the mineral soil to a depth of 200 cm was higher in the treatment plot, perhaps because of the lower volume of water that was moving through these soil layers in this plot. Decomposition of the litter showed no difference between plots. In sum, the small soil water reductions provoked during the first 2 years of partial throughfall exclusion were sufficient to lower aboveground NPP, including the stemwood increment that determines the amount of carbon stored in the forest. These results suggest that the net accumulation of carbon in mature Amazon forests indicated by recent permanent plot and eddy covariance studies may be very sensitive to small reductions in rainfall. The soil water reductions were also sufficient to increase soil emissions of N2O and to increase soil consumption of CH4-both radiatively important gases in the atmosphere. The possible reduction of tree reproductive activity points to potentially important effects of drought on the long-term species composition of Amazon forests. ",

Soil CO2 efflux, soil temperature and superficial soil water content were monitored in two young beech sites (H1 and H2) during a trenching experiment. Trenching induced a significant input of dead root mass that participated in soil CO2 efflux and reduced the soil dissolved organic carbon content, while it increased superficial soil water content within the trenched plot. Annual soil CO2 efflux in control plots was 528Â g C m-2 year-1 at H1 and 527Â g C m-2 year-1 at H2. The annual soil CO2 efflux in trenched plots was 353Â g C m-2 year-1 at H1 and 425Â g C m-2 year-1 at H2. By taking into account annual CO2 efflux from decaying trenched roots, the autotrophic contribution to total soil CO2 efflux reached 69% at H1 and 54% at H2. The partitioning calculation was highly sensitive to the initial root mass estimated within the trenched plots. Uncertainties in the remaining root mass, the fraction of root C that is incorporated into soil organic matter during root decomposition, and the root decomposition rate constant had a limited impact on the partitioning calculation. Corrections for differences in superficial soil water content had a significant impact on annual respired CO2 despite a limited effect on partitioning.",

Soil CO2 efflux was measured in 2003 and 2004 in seven beech plots differing in terms of soil type and leaf area index. After eliminating temporal fluctuations due to soil temperature and soil water content, standardized soil CO2 efflux varied significantly among plots over a large range given the homogeneity of the land cover type. Correlation analyses revealed that this spatial variability could not be explained by root biomass, litter C content, soil C contents, stand basal area or stem density. Conversely, very significant correlations were found with topsoil bulk density, superficial soil C/N ratio, and leaf area index. Multiple regression analysis led to a model relating standardized soil CO2 efflux to C/N ratio and topsoil bulk density, thus explaining 87% of observed inter-plot spatial variability. This study highlighted the need to consider spatially varying soil factors such as C/N ratio and bulk density when experimental schemes are elaborated to estimate mean soil CO2 efflux at forest scale.",

Accurate estimates of forest carbon are therefore required urgently to support efforts to conserve tropical forests. We quantified carbon stocks in primary and 60-year-old secondary forest plots located on infertile Ultisols in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, one of the few remaining areas of forest in Singapore. We used tree census data for 24.2Â ha of primary forest and 23Â ha of secondary forest, together with allometric equations, to estimate aboveground and coarse root biomass. Coarse woody debris stocks were censused along 2.44Â km and 2.12Â km of transects in primary and secondary forest, respectively. Soil carbon and fine root carbon stocks were assessed from soil samples taken to 3Â m depth in a 2-ha secondary forest plot and a 2-ha primary forest plot, combined with bulk density measured in a nearby soil profile pit. Total estimated carbon stock in the primary forest, which was located on the hilltop and upper slopes (80-115Â m elevation), was 337Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1, of which 50% was aboveground biomass, 33% in soil, 12% in coarse roots, 4.6% in coarse woody debris, and 0.8% in fine roots. In the secondary forest, located on lower slopes and valley (50-85Â m elevation), the total carbon stock was 274Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 and the relative importance of aboveground biomass and soil were reversed, with 38% in aboveground biomass, 52% in soil, 6.9% in coarse roots, 1.5% in coarse woody debris, and 1.3% in fine roots. Including carbon in deep subsoil (i.e. to 3Â m) increased soil carbon stocks by ~40% compared to 1Â m depth. Overall, the 60-year-old secondary forest contained 60% as much biomass as the primary forest, while the primary forest had lower carbon stocks than other primary forests in the region.",

Mean soil CO2 efflux in May-October increased with elevated CO2 by 23-37%, with elevated temperature by 27-43%, and with the combined treatment by 35-59%. Temperature elevation was a significant factor in the combined 4-year efflux data, whereas the effect of elevated CO2 was not as evident. Elevated temperature had the most pronounced impact early and late in the season, while the influence of elevated CO2 alone was especially notable late in the season. Needle area was found to be a significant predictor of soil CO2 efflux, particularly in August, a month of high root growth, thus supporting the assumption of a close link between whole-tree physiology and soil CO2 emissions. The decrease in the temperature sensitivity of soil CO2 efflux observed in the elevated temperature treatments in the second year nevertheless suggests the existence of soil response mechanisms that may be independent of the assimilating component of the forest ecosystem. In conclusion, elevated atmospheric CO2 and air temperature consistently increased forest soil CO2 efflux over the 4-year period, their combined effect being additive, with no apparent interaction.

However, limited information is available on individual root masses, especially large trees. We excavated 121 root systems of various species (78) and sizes (up to 116 cm in dbh), and estimated both above- and below-ground biomass in a lowland primary dipterocarp forest in the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. A tree census was conducted in four research plots (each 0.2 ha) and stand-level biomass was estimated. We examined relationships between tree size parameters and masses of coarse roots (roots ?5 mm in diameter) and derived a dbh-based allometric equation. The amounts of coarse roots that were lost during excavation were corrected. Coarse-root biomass before and after correction for lost roots was estimated to be 63.8 and 82.7 Mg ha?1, indicating that significant amounts of roots (23%) were lost during the sampling. We also estimated the biomass of small root (<5 mm) by applying pipe-model theory. The estimate, 13.3 Mg ha?1, was similar to another estimate of small roots, 16.4 Mg ha?1, which was obtained directly by the soil-pit sampling method. Total below-ground (BGB) and above-ground biomass (AGB) was estimated to be 95.9 and 536 Mg ha?1, respectively. The biomass-partitioning ratio (BGB/AGB) was about 0.18. In conclusion, the dbh-based allometric equation for coarse roots developed in this study, which kept good linearity even including the data of larger trees, might be useful for evaluating below-ground carbon stocks in other stands of similar forest (old-growth dipterocarp) in South-East Asia.",

We used static chambers to measure soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) efflux, and tension lysimeters to measure nitrate (NO3-) leaching, in newly-established poplar and willow plantation plots, and in reference pasture plots. Emissions of N2O increased markedly following cultivation with cumulative direct N2O emissions of 0.3, 4.6 and 5.9Â MgÂ ha-1 of CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) in the reference, willow and poplar plots, respectively. Similarly, land conversion resulted in large increases of NO3- leaching with losses of 2.6, 38.8 and 53.9Â kgÂ ha-1 of N from the reference, willow and poplar plots, respectively. Soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by land-use conversion; soils from willow and poplar plots emitted 29-42% less CO2 relative to the reference plots. Greater root respiration in the pastureland likely explained the greater soil CO2 efflux in these plots. Estimates of the net GHG emissions due to land-use conversion were strongly influenced by assumptions regarding the root contribution (RC) to total soil CO2 efflux. Assuming an RCÂ =Â 50%, we estimate that pastureland conversion at this site incurred GHG debts of 7.4 and 11.6Â MgÂ ha-1Â y-1 as CO2eq for willow and poplar, respectively, during the establishment year. These results demonstrate the need to include soil disturbance impacts on the N cycle in future life cycle assessment of these bioenergy crops.",

SRa and SRh were distinguished underneath groups of beech and spruce trees using the root exclusion method. Seasonal courses of SRa and SRh were studied from 2002 to 2004, with the summer of 2003 being extraordinarily warm and dry in Central Europe. We (1) analyzed the soil temperature (T s) and moisture sensitivity of SRa and SRh underneath both tree species, and (2) examined whether drought caused differential decline of SRa between spruce and beech. Throughout the study period, SRa of beech accounted for 45-55% of SRt, independent of the soil water regime; in contrast, SRa was significantly reduced during drought in spruce, and amounted then to only 25% of SRt. In parallel, fine-root production was decreased during 2003 by a factor of six in spruce (from 750 to 130Â mgÂ l-1Â a-1), but remained at levels similar to those in 2002 in beech (about 470Â mgÂ l-1Â a-1). This species-specific root response to drought was related to a stronger decline of SRa in spruce (by about 70%) compared to beech (by about 50%). The sensitivity of SRa and SRh to changing T s and available soil water was stronger in SRa than SRh in spruce, but not so in beech. It is concluded that SRa determines the effect of prolonged drought on the C efflux from soil to a larger extent in spruce than beech, having potential implications for respective forest types.",

The N2070 treatment represents the recommended start density in practical forestry, while the other represent a moderate to large reduction in tree number at the present stand age. Aboveground biomass was estimated from single tree measurements of diameter and height based on allometric functions. Litter fall was collected during one and a half years and soil respiration was measured on five occasions during one summer. Ground vegetation was mapped and sampled for biomass, C and N determination. A significant decrease in aboveground tree (including stump-root system) C storage of 27% and 22% due to thinning was found in the N820 and N1100 treatments, respectively, compared to the N2070 treatment. Ground vegetation C storage was little affected by treatment, while litter fall C showed a non-significant decrease in the N820 and N1100 treatments compared to the N2070 treatment. Soil respiration was significantly lower in parts of the summer in the N2070 treatment compared to the N820 treatment. The reason for this is still unexplained since no differences in soil temperature, soil moisture or litter fall chemistry was found between the treatments. No significant treatment effects on humus and mineral soil C storage could be detected. With the present soil variability, the time period of 32 years is probably too short to detect soil C differences due to thinning. The N storage followed the same pattern as for C.",

Here, we report C pools and CO2 exchange rates during three hydrologically contrasting years (i.e. 2005-2007) in a coastal plain loblolly pine plantation in North Carolina, USA. The daily temperatures were similar among the study years and to the long-term (1971-2000) average, whereas the amount and timing of precipitation differed significantly. Precipitation was the largest in 2005 (147 mm above normal), intermediate in 2006 (48 mm below) and lowest in 2007 (486 mm below normal). The forest was a strong C sink during all years, sequestering 361 Â± 67 (2005), 835 Â± 55 (2006) and 724 Â± 55 (2007) g C m-2 yr-1 according to eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). The interannual differences in NEE were traced to drought-induced declines in canopy and whole tree hydraulic conductances, which declined with growing precipitation deficit and decreasing soil volumetric water content (VWC). In contrast, the interannual differences were small in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), both seemingly insensitive to drought. However, the drought sensitivity of GEP was masked by higher leaf area index and higher photosynthetically active radiation during the dry year. Normalizing GEP by these factors enhanced interannual differences, but there were no signs of suppressed GEP at low VWC during any given year. Although ER was very consistent across the 3 years, and not suppressed by low VWC, the total respiratory cost as a fraction of net primary production increased with annual precipitation and the contribution of heterotrophic respiration (Rh) was significantly higher during the wettest year, exceeding new litter inputs by 58%. Although the difference was smaller during the other 2 years (Rh : litterfall ratio was 1.05 in 2006 and 1.10 in 2007), the soils lost about 109 g C m-2 yr-1, outlining their potential vulnerability to decomposition, and pointing to potential management considerations to protect existing soil C stocks.

Net primary productivity (NPP) of a closed-canopy Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand was assessed for three years in a free-air CO2-enrichment (FACE) experiment. NPP increased 21% in stands exposed to elevated CO2, and there was no loss of response over time. Wood increment increased significantly during the first year of exposure, but subsequently most of the extra C was allocated to production of leaves and fine roots. These pools turn over more rapidly than wood, thereby reducing the potential of the forest stand to sequester additional C in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Hence, while this experiment provides the first evidence that CO2 enrichment can increase productivity in a closed-canopy deciduous forest, the implications of this result must be tempered because the increase in productivity resulted in faster cycling of C through the system rather than increased C storage in wood. The fate of the additional C entering the soil system and the environmental interactions that influence allocation need further investigation. ",

The cumulated soil CO2 efflux over 1 year was not significantly different in the two treatments and averaged 658Â gÂ CÂ m-2. In contrast, tree growth was significantly increased by disk harrowing, maybe as a result of decreased soil penetration resistance. Carbon inputs to the soil from savannah residues (428Â gÂ CÂ m-2) were outweighed by the annual carbon outputs through heterotrophic respiration (505 and 456Â gÂ CÂ m-2 in the H and D treatments, respectively) leading to a slightly negative soil carbon budget in both treatments 1 year after afforestation.",

We tested the hypothesis that F s increases with stand age after afforestation, due to an increasing input of fresh organic matter to the forest floor. In a Eucalyptus plantation established on coastal savannahs in Congo, bimonthly measurements of F s were carried out for 1Â year on three adjacent stands aged 0.9, 4.4 and 13.7Â years and presenting similar growth patterns. Litterfall and litter accumulation on the forest floor were quantified over a chronosequence. Equations were derived to estimate the contribution of litter decomposition to F s throughout the rotation. Litterfall increased with stand age after savannah afforestation. F s , that was strongly correlated on a seasonal basis with soil water content (SWC) in all stands, decreased between ages 0.9Â year and 4.4Â years due to savannah residue depletion, and increased between ages 4.4Â years and 13.7Â years, mainly because of an increasing amount of decomposing eucalypt litter. The aboveground litter layer therefore appeared as a major source of CO2, whose contribution to F s in old stands was estimated to be about four times higher than that of the eucalypt-derived soil organic C pool. The high litter contribution to F s in older stands might explain why 13.7Â years-old stand F s was limited by moisture all year round whereas SWC did not limit F s for large parts of the year in the youngest stands.",

We studied the short-term changes to the carbon cycle in a mixed stand of hemlock and hardwoods, where hemlock was declining due to either girdling or HWA infestation. We expected that hemlock would decline more rapidly from girdling than from HWA infestation. Unexpectedly, in response to both girdling and HWA infestation, hemlock basal area increment (BAI) reduced substantially compared to reference hardwoods in 3Â years. This decline was concurrent with moderate increases in the BAI of co-occurring hardwoods. Although the girdling treatment resulted in an initial pulse of hemlock needle inputs, cumulative litter inputs and O horizon mass did not differ between treatments over the study period. Following girdling and HWA infestation, very fine root biomass declined by 20-40% in 2Â years, which suggests hemlock root mortality in the girdling treatment, and a reduction in hemlock root production in the HWA treatment. Soil CO2 efflux (E soil) declined by approximately 20% in 1Â year after both girdling and HWA infestation, even after accounting for the intra-annual variability of soil temperature and moisture. The reduction in E soil and the concurrent declines in BAI and standing very fine root biomass suggest rapid declines in hemlock productivity from HWA infestation. The accelerated inputs of detritus resulting from hemlock mortality are likely to influence carbon and nutrient fluxes, and dictate future patterns of species regeneration in these forest ecosystems.",

However, there are very little data on GHG methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dambos, and this study presents the first estimates from dambos in Zimbabwe. The objective was to evaluate the effects of catena positions; upland, dambo mid-slope and dambo bottom, on GHG emissions along an undisturbed dambo transect. Methane emissions were -0.3, 29.5 and -1.3Â mgÂ m-2Â hr-1, N2O emission were 40.1, 3.9 and 5.5Â ÂµgÂ m2Â hr-1, while CO2 emissions were 2648.9, 896.2 and 590.1Â mgÂ m-2Â hr-1 for upland, mid-slope and bottom catena, respectively.

Dambo bottom catena was weak source GHGs. Overall, dambos were major sources of CH4 and weak sources of N2O and CO2.We concluded that, depending on catenal position, dambos can be major or minor sources of GHGs.",

At the same time, it is generally believed that P does not limit soil microorganism respiration or growth in terrestrial ecosystems. We used natural gradients in P fertility created by soils of varying age underlying tropical rain forests in southwestern Costa Rica, combined with direct manipulations of carbon (C) and P supply, to test the effects of P availability on the decomposition of multiple forms of C, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Results from a combination of laboratory and field experiments suggest that C decomposition in old, highly weathered oxisol soils is strongly constrained by P availability. In addition, P additions to these soils (no C added) also revealed that microbial utilization of at least labile fractions of SOC was also P limited. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of P limitation of microbial processes in tropical rain forest soil. We suggest that P limitation of microbial decomposition may have profound implications for C cycling in moist tropical forests, including their potential response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Furthermore, this site is still relatively rich in P when compared to many other tropical forests on old soils; thus, we believe that P limitation of soil microorganisms throughout the humid tropics is a possibility.

Using a small gap (2.5 m x 2.5 m) enabled us to maintain the same soil temperature and soil moisture as found in the stand. Seasonal fluctuations in soil respiration, increasing in summer and decreasing in winter, corresponded to changes in the soil surface temperature. Soil respiration in the gap site did not differ significantly from those in the stand in the first year of gap formation. However, in the second year, the minimum CO2 flux was observed at the center of the gap and the maximum at the edge of the surrounding stand. Assuming that the differences between soil respiration in the center of the gap and that in the stand were equal to the root respiration, the root respiration rate was calculated from the relationship between the root respiration rates (Rr) and the soil surface temperature (Ts) by Ln(Rr) = 0.07Ts + 3.48.

Spatial variability of soil respiration varied between seasons, with the highest coefficient variation in winter (42%) and lowest in summer (26%). Semivariogram analysis and kriged maps revealed different patterns of spatial distribution in each season. Factors affecting the spatial variability were relief index (autumn), soil hardness of the A layer (winter), soil hardness at 50Â cm depth (spring) and the altitude and relief index (summer). Annual soil respiration (average: 39Â molÂ m-2Â y-1) varied from 26Â molÂ m-2Â y-1 to 55Â molÂ m-2Â y-1 between the 35 locations and was higher in the upper part of the slope and lower in the lower part.

Soil CO2 efflux varied widely in space; the range of variation averaged 17.4Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in total. While most CO2 flux rates were under 10Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, exceptionally high fluxes were observed sporadically at several sampling points.

However, little is known about the impact of anthropogenic activities, such as logging and subsequent forest succession, on these fluxes. In this study, we measured the CO2 efflux and temperature of wood ant mounds and the surrounding forest floor in managed Finnish boreal forests of different ages (5, 30, 60, and 100 years old) to assess how the effluxes vary with stand age. We conducted efflux measurements from the mounds and the surrounding forest floor throughout the ants' active season (May-September) and during the onset of hibernation (October). The annual CO2 efflux was then estimated using mound or forest floor temperatures, which were measured for one year. The average annual CO2 efflux from the ant mounds was 10.2 (Â±5.8 SD) kgÂ m-2Â year-1, increasing from 3.9 (Â±0.3 SD) kgÂ m-2Â year-1 in the 5 year-old stands to 14.3 (Â±3.0 SD)Â kg m-2Â year-1 in the 100 year-old stands. Temperatures was significantly higher in the ant mounds than in the forest floor, and the average temperature difference between mounds and forest floor increased with stand age, being the lowest in the 5 year-old (4.1 (Â±3.1 SD) Â°C) and highest in the 100 year-old stands (10.3 (Â±5.2 SD) Â°C). There were no statistical differences in the mound CO2 efflux per volume among forest age classes, suggesting higher ant CO2 efflux in the older stands likely come from larger ant populations in the bigger mounts. The different mound temperature regimes among stand age classes indicates that the activity of wood ants changes with forest succession, particularly after clear-cutting, which alters CO2 efflux from the mounds. The impact of ant mounds on total CO2 efflux from the soil, estimated from mound area and volume, respectively, increased with forest age, from 0.05 (Â±0.05 SD) % to 0.31 (Â±0.18 SD) % and from 0.05 (Â±0.06 SD) % to 0.90% (Â±1.11 SD).",

CO2 hot spots (>10 Âµmol m-2 s-1) were found with extremely high values (15-25 Âµmol m-2 s-1). Each CO2 hot spot occurred sporadically at different times and locations. It is hypothesized that animal activities are responsible for the hot spots. The impact of CO2 hot spots on total soil respiration was 10%, which is comparable to the estimation of net C balance in tropical rainforests. ",

NPP was calculated as the sum of the living biomass of new-season tissue in all organs (B) and biomass of new-season tissue lost due to death (L). Annual leaf-litter production was adopted as L. We regarded the total tree growth in the stand as B, and examined three methods for estimating B to discuss the practicality of continuous measurement of NPP to compare with corresponding estimates of eddy-covariance based net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The three methods were diameter at breast height (DBH)-growth allometry by stem analysis of sample trees (SA method), DBH-growth allometry by core sample analysis of sample trees (CS method) and direct measurement of stem growth by tree census (TC method). The total annual tree growth in the forest stand estimated by the SA, CS and TC methods was 2.26, 1.60 and 2.38Â MgÂ ha-1, respectively, and NPP was 5.64, 4.98 and 5.74Â MgÂ ha-1. The slope of the regression of DBH against annual tree growth was slightly smaller for the CS method than for the SA method; the CS method underestimated the growth of several sample trees that had no clear main stem and, as a result, greatly underestimated B. To estimate B, the SA and CS methods depend on the use of DBH-growth allometry. Thus, it is difficult to determine species-dependent growth in natural mixed forests by these methods if only a few sample trees are used. In contrast, the TC method can directly and continuously measure the growth of all tree stems. Therefore, the TC method is the most suitable method for measuring NPP through annual measurements of tree diameter and leaf-litter production allowing for direct comparison with eddy-covariance based estimate of NEE.",

Biometric based NEP, as measured by the balance between net primary production (including NPP of canopy trees and of forest floor dwarf bamboo) and heterotrophic respiration (RH), clarified the contribution of various biological processes to the ecosystem carbon budget, and also showed where and how the forest is storing C. The mean NPP of the trees was 5.4Â Â±Â 1.07Â tÂ CÂ ha-1 y-1, including biomass increment (0.3Â Â±Â 0.82Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1), tree mortality (1.0Â Â±Â 0.61Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1), aboveground detritus production (2.3Â Â±Â 0.39Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1) and belowground fine root production (1.8Â Â±Â 0.31Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1).

Biometric NEP in the forest was estimated at 2.1Â Â±Â 1.15Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â y-1, which agreed well with the eddy-covariance based net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The contribution of woody increment (<U+0394>biomassÂ +Â mortality) of the canopy trees to NEP was rather small, and thus the SOM pool played an important role in carbon storage in the temperate forest.

This opened up an opportunity for studies that compare the interannual variability in tree growth with eddy covariance-based net ecosystem production (NEP). A possible link between multiyear biometric-based net primary production (NPP) and eddy covariance-based NEP was investigated to determine the contribution of autotrophic production and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to the interannual variability of NEP in deciduous forest ecosystems. We also defined the NEP* as the measurable organic matter stored in an ecosystem during the interval in which soil respiration (SR) measurements were taken. The difference of biometric-based NEP* from eddy covariance-based NEP within a given year varied between 55% and 105%. Woody tissue NPP (stems and coarse roots) varied markedly from 0.88 to 1.96 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 during the 8-year study period (1999-2006). Annual woody tissue NPP was positively correlated with eddy covariance-based NEP (r2=0.52, P<0.05). However, neither foliage NPP (r2=0.03) nor HR (r2=0.06) were correlated with eddy covariance-based NEP. Therefore, it was hypothesized that interannual variability in the ecosystem carbon exchange was directly responsible for much of the interannual variation in autotrophic production, especially carbon accumulation in the woody components of the ecosystem. Moreover, similar interannual variations of biometric-based NEP* and eddy covariance-based NEP with small variations in SR and foliage NPP suggest a constant net accumulation of carbon in nonliving pools at the Takayama site.

However, our understanding of how secondary succession affects carbon cycling and carbon sequestration in these ecosystems is limited. We studied carbon cycling and net ecosystem production (NEP) over 4Â years (2004-2008) in a cool-temperate deciduous forest at an early stage of secondary succession (18Â years after clear-cutting). Net primary production of the 18-year-old forest in this study was 5.2Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1, including below-ground coarse roots; this was partitioned into 2.5Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1 biomass increment, 1.6Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1 foliage litter, and 1.0Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1 other woody detritus.

The 18-year forest at this study site exhibited a great increase in biomass pool as a result of considerable total tree growth and low mortality of tree stems. In contrast, the soil organic matter (SOM) pool decreased markedly (-1.6Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1), although further study of below-ground detritus production and RH of SOM decomposition is needed. This young 18-year forest was a weak carbon sink (0.9Â tCÂ ha-1Â year-1) at this stage of secondary succession. The NEP of this 18-year forest is likely to increase gradually because biomass increases with tree growth and with the improvement of the SOM pool through increasing litter and dead wood production with stand development.",

For the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances on a country-wide basis, it is necessary to know how soil-atmosphere fluxes are associated with variables that are available for spatial upscaling. We measured momentary soil-atmosphere CO2 (heterotrophic and total soil respiration), CH4 and N2O fluxes at 68 forestry-drained peatland sites in Finland over two growing seasons. We estimated annual CO2 effluxes for the sites using site-specific temperature regressions and simulations in half-hourly time steps. Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes were interpolated from the measurements. We then tested how well climate and site variables derived from forest inventory results and weather statistics could be used to explain between-site variation in the annual fluxes. The estimated annual CO2 effluxes ranged from 1165 to 4437Â gÂ m-2Â year-1 (total soil respiration) and from 534 to 2455Â gÂ m-2Â year-1 (heterotrophic soil respiration). Means of 95% confidence intervals were Â±12% of total and Â±22% of heterotrophic soil respiration. Estimated annual CO2 efflux was strongly correlated with soil respiration at the reference temperature (10Â Â°C) and with summer mean air temperature. Temperature sensitivity had little effect on the estimated annual fluxes. Models with tree stand stem volume, site type and summer mean air temperature as independent variables explained 56% of total and 57% of heterotrophic annual CO2 effluxes. Adding summer mean water table depth to the models raised the explanatory power to 66% and 64% respectively. Most of the sites were small CH4 sinks and N2O sources. The interpolated annual CH4 flux (range: -0.97 to 12.50Â gÂ m-2Â year-1) was best explained by summer mean water table depth (r2Â =Â 64%) and rather weakly by tree stand stem volume (r2Â =Â 22%) and mire vegetation cover (r2Â =Â 15%). N2O flux (range: -0.03 to 0.92Â gÂ m-2Â year-1) was best explained by peat CN ratio (r2Â =Â 35%). Site type explained 13% of annual N2O flux. We suggest that water table depth should be measured in national land-use inventories for improving the estimation of country-level GHG fluxes for peatlands.",

Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (<U+0394>Csoil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (Rfloor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (Rhet) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of <U+0394>Csoil has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, <U+0394>Csoil was calculated by subtracting Rhet from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, Rfloor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.The Rhet method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The Rfloor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.In our opinion, the Rhet method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the Rfloor method. As the estimation of <U+0394>Csoil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.",

It introduces a large pulse of harvest residues (brash) to the soil surface and can alter the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. This study determined the influence of thinning, microclimatic factors and plant productivity on carbon (C) losses through the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) respired from thinning lines (brash lanes or BL) and the forest floor (FF: without brash) in a first rotation Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) forest in Ireland. Weekly measurements of CO2 efflux were carried out using an Infra-Red Gas Analyser connected to static chambers; while soil moisture content and soil surface temperature were measured, using theta probes and data loggers, respectively. The soil respiration measurements were also correlated with the gross primary productivity (GPP) determined by eddy covariance techniques.The highest CO2 efflux were observed at the peak of summer in July/2010 (FFÂ =Â 699.20Â mgÂ CO2Â m-2Â h-1 and BLÂ =Â 374.22Â mgÂ CO2Â m-2Â h-1) and were associated with maximum soil surface temperatures and higher rates of GPP. Soil temperature had a strong positive influence on the variation of CO2 from the forest (FFÂ =Â 75% and BLÂ =Â 59%), and the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration from the FF (5.47) was higher than from the BL (2.72). Soil moisture was inversely correlated with soil respiration from both FF (RÂ =Â -0.73, pÂ <Â 0.0001) and BL (RÂ =Â -0.53, pÂ =Â 0.003). The combined effect of temperature and moisture gave a better description of the variability in CO2 respired from both the FF (R2Â =Â 0.85, pÂ <Â 0.0001) and BL (R2Â =Â 0.67, pÂ <Â 0.0001) than temperature and/or moisture alone.

Here, we examined the degree to which canopy nitrogen can serve as an indicator of patterns of NPP at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire by linking canopy nitrogen estimates from two high spectral resolution remote sensing instruments with field measurements and an ecosystem model. Predicted NPP across the study area ranged from less than 700Â gÂ m-2Â year-1 to greater than 1300Â gÂ m-2Â year-1 with a mean of 951Â gÂ m-2Â year-1. Spatial patterns corresponded with elevation, species composition and historical forest management, all of which were reflected in patterns of canopy nitrogen. The relationship between production and elevation was nonlinear, with an increase from low- to mid-elevation deciduous stands, followed by a decline in upper-elevation areas dominated by evergreens. This pattern was also evident in field measurements and mirrored an elevational trend in foliar N concentrations. The increase in production from low-to mid-elevation deciduous stands runs counter to the generally accepted pattern for the northeastern U.S. region, and suggests an importance of moisture limitations in lower-elevation forests.Field measurements of foliar N, wood production and leaf litterfall were also used to evaluate sources of error in model estimates and to determine how predictions are affected by different methods of acquiring foliar N input data. The accuracy of predictions generated from remotely sensed foliar N approached that of predictions driven by field-measured foliar N. Predictions based on the more common approach of using aggregated foliar N for individual cover types showed reasonable agreement in terms of the overall mean, but were in poor agreement on a plot-by-plot basis. Collectively, these results suggest that variation in foliar N exerts an important control on landscape-level spatial patterns and can serve as an integrator of other underlying factors that influence forest growth rates.",

In these systems, the environmental factor that most directly controlled rates of carbon exchange varied depending upon burn status and soil drainage. In mature unburned stands, CO2 flux was highly correlated with seasonal patterns of soil temperature. Following fire, these soils became significantly warmer, and carbon exchange became more sensitive to fluctuations in surface moisture conditions. The effect of fire on soil climate was most pronounced in the P. mariana stands, which experienced a mean seasonal temperature increase of 5<U+0096>8Â°C in the upper 1 m of the soil profile, a 200% increase in the rate of active layer thaw, and a reduction in mean surface moisture potential. Evidence from soil CO2 profiles suggests that these environmental changes may have resulted in enhanced decomposition of carbon previously immobilized by permafrost, potentially transforming a landscape that was once a net sink for carbon into a carbon source.",

Understanding the ecological controls that regulate these disturbance effects is critical to developing models of ecosystem response to changes in fire frequency and severity. This paper combines laboratory and field measurements along a chronosequence of burned black spruce stands into regression analyses and models that assess relationships between moss succession, soil microclimate, decomposition, and C source-sink dynamics. Results indicate that post-fire changes in temperature and substrate quality increased decomposition in humic materials by a factor of 3.0 to 4.0 in the first 7Â years after fire. Bryophyte species exhibited a distinct successional pattern in the first five decades after fire that corresponded to decreased soil temperature and increased C accumulation in organic soils. Potential rates of C exchange in mosses were greatest in early successional species and declined as the stand matured. Residual sources of CO2 (those not attributed to moss respiration or humic decomposition) increased as a function of stand age, reflecting increased contributions from roots as the stand recovered from disturbance. Together, the field measurements, laboratory experiments, and models provide strong evidence that interactions between moss and plant succession, soil temperature, and soil moisture largely regulate C source-sink dynamics from black spruce systems in the first century following fire disturbance.",

A total of 120 trees were harvested and weighed to provide data for the estimation of biomass as well as for developing biomass equations. The results showed that Gmelina has high biomass yield, ranging from 83.2tha-1 (5 years) to 394.9tha-1 (21 years). Mean annual biomass increment varied from 16.2 to 20.9tha-1yr-1. Average biomass allocations to different components of the tree were as follows: Stem about 84%; branch 13% and foliage 3%. The high biomass values were attributed to fast growth, high stand density (range: 837-1275stemsha-1) and good site conditions in the study area. Biomass values of the various tree components (stem, branch and foliage) as well as total above-ground biomass (TAGB) were regressed with diameter at breast height (dbh) on the one hand (equation form 1), and with dbh and total height (in the form of D2H) on the other (equation form 2), with the aim of choosing the most suitable equation form. All equations generated had very high adjusted R2 and very low standard error of estimate. Residuals for both equation forms were normally and randomly distributed. Only little improvement in the ability of the equations to explain the variations in biomass was achieved by including the variable of total height. Considering the ease and accuracy in obtaining dbh data and the enormous time, errors and difficulty in obtaining height data, the equation form involving only dbh data as independent variable was recommended for use in estimating biomass for Gmelina in Oluwa forest reserve.",

The experiment comprised three treatments: deep soil frost, shallow soil frost and control plots (n= 3). Winter soil temperatures and soil frost distribution were significantly altered by the different treatments. The average soil CO2 concentrations during the growing season were significantly lower in plots with deep soil frost than in plots with shallow soil frost. The average CO2 soil-atmosphere exchange rate exhibited the same pattern, and differences in soil respiration rates among the treatments were statistically significant. Both the variation in soil CO2 concentration and the CO2 soil-atmosphere exchange rate could statistically be explained by the differences in the maximum soil frost depth during the previous winter. A response model for growing season soil respiration rates suggests that every 1 cm change in winter soil frost depth will change the emission rates by ca. 0.01 g CO2 m-2 day-1, corresponding to 0.2-0.5% of the estimated net ecosystem productivity (NEP). This suggests that the soil frost regime has a significant influence on the C balance of the system, because interannual variations in soil frost up to 60 cm have been recorded at the site. We conclude that winter climate conditions can be important in controlling C balances in northern terrestrial ecosystems, and also that indirect effects of the winter season must be taken into account, because these can affect the prevailing conditions during the growing season.

A spatial variability experiment, in which EC measurements were made from six towers within the RSL in a uniform pine plantation, quantified large and dynamic spatial variation in fluxes. The spatial coefficient of variation (CV) of the scalar fluxes decreased with increasing integration time, stabilizing at a minimum that was independent of further lengthening the averaging period (hereafter a â€˜stable minimum'). For all three fluxes, the stable minimum (CV=9-11%) was reached at averaging times (tp) of 6-7 h during daytime, but higher stable minima (CV=46-158%) were reached at longer tp (>12 h) during nighttime. To the extent that decreasing CV of EC fluxes reflects reduction in micrometeorological sampling errors, half of the observed variability at tp=30 min is attributed to sampling errors. The remaining half (indicated by the stable minimum CV) is attributed to underlying variability in ecosystem structural properties, as determined by leaf area index, and perhaps associated ecosystem activity attributes. We further assessed the spatial variability estimates in the context of uncertainty in annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE). First, we adjusted annual NEE values obtained at our long-term observation tower to account for the difference between this tower and the mean of all towers from this experiment; this increased NEE by up to 55 g C m-2 yr-1. Second, we combined uncertainty from gap filling and instrument error with uncertainty because of spatial variability, producing an estimate of variability in annual NEE ranging from 79 to 127 g C m-2 yr-1. This analysis demonstrated that even in such a uniform pine plantation, in some years spatial variability can contribute ~50% of the uncertainty in annual NEE estimates. ",

This understanding is needed for performance based mechanisms that aim to halt global warming (REDD+). Despite the importance of secondary forests to global C cycling, the impacts of recovering secondary vegetation on C dynamics are poorly understood. We present carbon stocks and accumulation rates in biomass and soil pools, using as a basis of analysis 87 sampling plots established along a secondary forest chronosequence derived from shifting cultivation. We test the influence of age, land-use intensity (prior land-use history) and two site quality indices on the size of the C stocks and C accumulation rates. Biomass and Total C pools were positively correlated with age and negatively with LU intensity, whereas C accumulation rates had opposite signs for both parameters. Soil C did not show any variation along the age gradient, but C in the upper 20 cm was positively correlated to both site quality indices. The LU-intensity influenced the tree C stock in the younger plots. We propose a nested approach in which detailed studies can be up-scaled to landscape and regional estimates of carbon pools in forest fallow and undisturbed forests and carbon accumulation rates in forest fallow.",

Using sequential soil coring and a decomposition experiment, patterns of fine-root (<2 mm diameter) biomass, belowground net primary productivity, and root turnover rates were examined over a 1-yr period in three sites along a forest chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands. These sites form a natural fertility gradient but have similar species composition, climate, and geology. The youngest site (300 yr old) was low in N availability, the oldest site (4.1 x 106 yr old) was low in P availability, and the intermediate-aged site (20 000 yr old) was higher in both N and P. The youngest and oldest sites also contained long-term fertilization plots that were fertilized with N or P, or were unfertilized (control). Along the natural fertility gradient, the oldest site generally differed from the other two sites; this site had the greatest standing stock of live root mass, the greatest root length density, the lowest belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and the slowest root turnover rate. The 300-yr-old and 20 000-yr-old sites were similar in all of these variables, except that root turnover was slightly faster at the 300-yr-old site. The response of fine roots to fertilization was consistent with the response along the natural fertility gradient. Despite N limitation to aboveground growth at the 300-yr-old site, fertilization had small effects on root variables, with the only significant effects being a small increase in the standing stock of live root biomass in N-fertilized plots and an increase in root tissue P concentrations in P-fertilized plots. In contrast, fertilization at the 4.1 x 106 yr-old site altered root dynamics more than fertilization at the 300-yr-old site. In the P-fertilized plots, P concentrations increased, BNPP tended to be greater, and root turnover rates increased. These results suggest that root dynamics differ dramatically between ecosystems low in N and ecosystems low in P, even though each system is regarded as â€œinfertile.â€ N availability had a smaller effect on root dynamics than did P availability, suggesting that the simple dichotomy between fertile and infertile sites that is often evoked to explain plant characteristics may be unjustified.

We used a well-replicated 80-year pasture to forest successional chronosequence and primary forest in Puerto Rico to explore the relationships among litterfall, litter quality, decomposition, and soil C pools. Litterfall rates recovered rapidly during early secondary succession and averaged 10.5 (Â± 0.1 SE) Mg/ha/y among all sites over a 2-year period. Although forest plant community composition and plant life form dominance changed during succession, litter chemistry as evaluated by sequential C fractions and by 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not change significantly with forest age, nor did leaf decomposition rates. Root decomposition was slower than leaves and was fastest in the 60-year-old sites and slowest in the 10- and 30-year-old sites. Common litter and common site experiments suggested that site conditions were more important controls than litter quality in this chronosequence. Bulk soil C content was positively correlated with hydrophobic leaf compounds, suggesting that there is greater soil C accumulation if leaf litter contains more tannins and waxy compounds relative to more labile compounds. Our results suggest that most key C fluxes associated with litter production and decomposition re-establish rapidly-within a decade or two-during tropical secondary succession. Therefore, recovery of leaf litter C cycling processes after pasture use are faster than aboveground woody biomass and species accumulation, indicating that these young secondary forests have the potential to recover litter cycling functions and provide some of the same ecosystem services of primary forests.",

We used Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) methodology to establish forest dynamics plots in montane wet forest and lowland dry forest on Hawaiâ€˜i Island. We compared the species diversity, tree density, basal area, biomass, and size class distributions between the two forest types. We then examined these variables across tropical forests within the CTFS network. Consistent with other island forests, the Hawaiâ€˜i forests were characterized by low species richness and very high relative dominance. The two Hawaiâ€˜i forests were floristically distinct, yet similar in species richness (15 vs. 21 species) and stem density (3078 vs. 3486/ha). While these forests were selected for their low invasive species cover relative to surrounding forests, both forests averaged 5->50% invasive species cover; ongoing removal will be necessary to reduce or prevent competitive impacts, especially from woody species. The montane wet forest had much larger trees, resulting in eightfold higher basal area and above-ground biomass. Across the CTFS network, the Hawaiian montane wet forest was similar to other tropical forests with respect to diameter distributions, density, and aboveground biomass, while the Hawaiâ€˜i lowland dry forest was similar in density to tropical forests with much higher diversity. These findings suggest that forest structural variables can be similar across tropical forests independently of species richness. The inclusion of low-diversity Pacific Island forests in the CTFS network provides an ~80-fold range in species richness (15-1182 species), six-fold variation in mean annual rainfall (835-5272 mm yr-1) and 1.8-fold variation in mean annual temperature (16.0-28.4Â°C). Thus, the Hawaiian forest plots expand the global forest plot network to enable testing of ecological theory for links among species diversity, environmental variation and ecosystem function. ",

We investigated both across two riparian-hillslope transitions in a subalpine catchment, northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. Riparian-hillslope transitions provide ideal locations for investigating the controls on soil CO2 dynamics due to strong, natural gradients in the factors driving respiration, including soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature. We measured soil air CO2 concentrations (20 and 50Â cm), surface CO2 efflux, soil temperature, and SWC at eight locations. We investigated (1) how soil CO2 concentrations differed within and between landscape positions; (2) how the timing of peak soil CO2 concentrations varied across riparian and hillslope zones; and (3) whether higher soil CO2 concentrations necessarily resulted in higher efflux (i.e. did surface CO2 efflux follow patterns of subsurface CO2)? Soil CO2 concentrations were significantly higher in the riparian zones, likely due to higher SWC. The timing of peak soil CO2 concentrations also differed between riparian and hillslope zones, with highest hillslope concentrations near peak snowmelt and highest riparian concentrations during the late summer and early fall. Surface CO2 efflux was relatively homogeneous at monthly timescales as a result of different combinations of soil CO2 production and transport, which led to equifinality in efflux across the transects. However, efflux was 57% higher in the riparian zones when integrated to cumulative growing season efflux, and suggests higher riparian soil CO2 production.",

We assessed the effects of biological factors on Fff by comparing a maturing pine plantation (PP) and a nearby mature Oak-Hickory-type hardwood forest (HW). Fff was measured continuously with soil chambers connected to an IRGA during 2001-2002. At both sites, Fff depended on soil temperature at 5 cm (T5) when soil was moist (soil moisture, <U+03B8>>0.20 m3 m-3), and on both T5 and <U+03B8> when soil was drier. A model (Fff (T5, <U+03B8>)) explained 92% of the variation in the daily mean Fff at both sites. Higher radiation reaching the ground during the leafless period, and a thinner litter layer because of faster decomposition, probably caused higher soil temperature at HW compared with PP. The annual Fff was estimated at 1330 and 1464 g C m-2 yr-1 for a year with mild drought (2001) at PP and HW, respectively, and 1231 and 1557 g C m-2 yr-1 for a year with severe drought (2002). In the wetter year, higher soil temperature and moisture at HW compared with PP compensated for the negative effect on Fff of the response to these variables resulting in similar annual Fff at both stands. In the drier year, however, the response to soil temperature and moisture was more similar at the two stands causing the difference in the state variables to impel a higher Fff at HW. A simple mass balance indicated that in the wetter year, C in the litter-soil system was at steady state at HW, and was accruing at PP. However, HW was probably losing C from the mineral soil during the severe drought year of 2002, while PP was accumulating C at a lower rate because of a loss of C from the litter layer. Such contrasting behavior of two forest types in close proximity might frustrate attempts to estimate regional carbon (C) fluxes and net C exchange. ",

However, the dynamics of Rs and Q10 resulting from plantation thinning are not well understood. To evaluate the impacts of forest thinning on Rs and Q10, we selected a pine plantation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and applied the technique of thinning by simulating gap formation. We measured Rs monthly before (from July to November 2008) and after (from December 2008 to June 2012) thinning, combining with monthly microclimatic factors. Rs showed significant seasonal variability (PÂ <Â 0.001) in both control (0.30Â Â±Â 0.05 to 2.94Â Â±Â 0.29Â ÂµmolÂ CÂ m-2Â s-1) and thinned (0.25Â Â±Â 0.04 to 2.99Â Â±Â 0.08Â ÂµmolÂ CÂ m-2Â s-1) stands, with higher rates from July to September and lower rates from December to February. These seasonal dynamics were primarily driven by soil temperature rather than by moisture limitation, except during an especially dry season, when soil moisture significantly affected Rs. There were significant differences in Rs during the growing season between the control and thinned sites following thinning. Rs increased at the thinned sites compared with the control sites during the summer of the first and the third year following thinning; however, Rs decreased at the thinned sites in the second summer. This suggested that climatic variability, such as change in soil moisture induced from thinning, played an important role in controlling Rs. There was no significant difference (PÂ =Â 0.083) in Rs between control and thinned treatments after thinning (December 2008 to June 2012). For example, averages of Rs were 1.19Â Â±Â 0.34, 1.20Â Â±Â 0.36, 1.16Â Â±Â 0.38Â ÂµmolÂ CÂ m-2Â s-1 in the control, small gap and intermediate gap treatments, respectively. In addition, the short-term Q10 showed a significantly seasonal variability (PÂ <Â 0.001) and was altered by thinning (PÂ =Â 0.048). The long-term Q10 also showed a significant inter-annual variability (PÂ <Â 0.001), while thinning did not affect it. During the study period (December 2008 to June 2012), the Q10 values for the small and intermediate gaps significantly increased by 13.9% and 25.9% (PÂ <Â 0.05), respectively, compared with the control. These results suggest that the forest thinning by simulating natural gap formation has a relatively small impact on soil CO2 emission and its temperature sensitivity in comparison to the greater influence of inter-annual climatic variability.",

Measurements of the soil matric potential (<U+03A8>) indicated a gradient in drought intensity at the three sites (Vordemwald, Schanis, Beatenberg) with average <U+03A8> during the summer 2003 of -75, -41 and -5Â kPa, respectively. In Vordemwald where the drought was the most severe, the hourly soil CO2 efflux declined by about 30% when <U+03A8>Â <Â -90Â kPa. Estimated annual soil CO2 efflux in 2003 was about 10% smaller than effluxes in wetter years (2001, 2002 and 2004) but the differences were not significant. In Schanis and Beatenberg, no suppression of hourly soil CO2 efflux was observed during the summer 2003. The annual efflux in 2003 at both sites was 10-15% larger than the effluxes in the other years but the differences were not significant. DOC concentrations increased during the first rewetting events after the drought in Vordemwald and in Schanis. This was mainly due to a concentration effect due to the low soil water content. Because precipitation was lower in 2003, annual DOC fluxes substantially decreased at the three sites. Carbon sequestration in tree stems in Vordemwald declined by 32% in 2003 compared to the mean 2002-2005. In Beatenberg and Schanis, tree growth responded little to the extreme summer 2003. Litterfall at the three sites showed no marked reaction to the summer 2003. Estimate of annual net ecosystem production (NEP) suggested that the stands in Vordemwald and in Schanis remained a C sink between 2002 and 2005 but that the extreme summer 2003 caused a decrease in NEP. In Beatenberg, the impact on the NEP seemed to be limited in 2003. The annual NEP in 2003 decreased with increasing drought intensity over the three sites.",

At the optimal harvest age for maximum biomass production (4 years), total aboveground biomass ranged from 63Â MgÂ ha-1 in the Eucalyptus monoculture to 124Â MgÂ ha-1 in the Casuarina/Leucaena mixture, and was generally greater in the mixed-species than in single-species treatments due to increased productivity of the N-fixing species in the mixed stands. Total litterfall varied from 5.3 to 10.0Â MgÂ ha-1 year-1 among treatments, or between 5.9% and 13.2% of net primary production. Litterfall production and rates of nutrient return for N, P, K, Ca and Mg were generally highest for Leucaena, intermediate for Casuarina and lowest for Eucalyptus. These rates were usually higher in the mixed-species than in monospecific stands due to differences in biomass productivity, but varied considerably depending on their species composition. Total system carbon and nutrient pools (in biomass plus soils to 40-cm depth) for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn at four years were consistently greater in the plantation treatments than in the unplanted control plots. Relative to the single-species plantations, these system pools were generally larger in the mixed-species plantations for C (-10% to +10%), N (+17% to +50%), P (-1% to +63%), K (-19% to +46%), Ca (-10% to +48%), Mg (+5% to +57%) and Mn (+19% to +86%). Whole-tree harvests at four years would result in substantial system carbon and nutrient losses, although these estimated losses would not exceed the estimated gains realized during the four-year period of tree growth at this site. At 7.5 years, soil organic matter and effective cation exchange capacity were reduced in all plantation treatments relative to the control. Changes in soil nutrient content from 0 to 7.5 years were highly variable and not significantly different among treatments, although stands containing Leucaena generally showed higher rates of nitrogen and phosphorus accretion in soils than those with Eucalyptus and/or Casuarina. Natural regeneration of secondary forest tree and shrub species increased over time in all plantation treatments. A total of 24 native or naturalized forest species were recorded in the plantations at 8.5 years. Woody species abundance at this age was significantly greater beneath Casuarina than either Eucalyptus or the Eucalyptus/Leucaena mixed stands. Species richness and diversity, however, were greatest beneath stands containing Eucalyptus and/or Leucaena than in stands with Casuarina.",

These results contrast with previous assumptions that old-growth forest ecosystems are in carbon equilibrium. The basis for differences between conventional biomass-based carbon sequestration estimates and the biometeorologic estimates are discussed. Annual net ecosystem exchange was comparable to younger ecosystems at the same latitude, as quantified in the AmeriFlux program. Net ecosystem carbon uptake was significantly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, as well as soil moisture and precipitation. Optimum ecosystem photosynthesis occurred at relatively cool temperatures (5Â°-10Â°C). Understory and soil carbon exchange always represented a source of carbon to the atmosphere, with a strong seasonal cycle in source strength. Understory and soil carbon exchange showed a Q10 temperature dependence and represented a substantial portion of the ecosystem carbon budget. The period of main carbon uptake and the period of soil and ecosystem respiration are out of phase, however, and driven by different climatic boundary conditions. The period of strongest ecosystem carbon uptake coincides with the lowest observed values of soil and ecosystem respiration. Despite the substantial contribution of soil, the overall strength of the photosynthetic sink resulted in the net annual uptake. The net uptake estimates here included two correction methods, one for advection and the other for low levels of turbulence.",

Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes of a three-point black spruce harvest chronosequence located in the boreal forest of eastern North America were measured over a one-year period at the ecosystem scale with the eddy covariance technique and CO2 efflux from soils was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer. The three sites (pre-harvest, recently harvested, and juvenile) were 105-, 8- and 33-years old, respectively. On an annual basis, the pre-harvest site (EOBS) was a weak carbon sink (6Â Â±Â 4Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1), the recently harvested site (HBS00) a source (-87Â Â±Â 3Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1) and the juvenile site (HBS75) a moderate to strong sink (143Â Â±Â 35Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1). Annual gross ecosystem production (GEP) at the pre-harvest site was only 28% greater than at the recently harvested site (646Â Â±Â 6 versus 504Â Â±Â 5Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1), while GEP at the juvenile site (1107Â Â±Â 32Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1) was more than double that at the recently harvested site, suggesting significant physiological constraints to photosynthesis at the pre-harvest site. Annual ecosystem respiration (Re) followed the same pattern, but intersite differences were somewhat less (640Â Â±Â 8 to 591Â Â±Â 6 to 964Â Â±Â 50Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1). Annual soil respiration (Rs) decreased following harvest from 593 to 500Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1 and increased with further stand development to 644Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1, although the changes were less than for GEP and Re. Q10 and R10 of Rs for the snow-free period varied between sites, were lowest for the recently harvested site, and appeared to be related to GEP via substrate supply. The annual ratio of Rs to Re was lower for the juvenile site (67%) than for the pre-harvest and recently harvested sites (93 and 85%, respectively). These results quantify how some of the major physiological processes that influence the carbon cycle of boreal black spruce stands evolve following harvest and should be useful for better incorporating stand-age effects into regional and global scale models.",

Thus far, the impact of preparing peat soil on greenhouse gas fluxes is a chapter unwritten in GHG research on forestry-drained peatlands. Not only is such information vital in order to accurately estimate the GHG balance nationally, it may dictate the very methods used to regenerate forests on peat soils in the future. Over a 22-month period, we studied the impacts of mounding and scalping relative to the control on soil CO2 (heterotrophic peat soil respiration, SRp), CH4, and N2O fluxes along a moisture gradient in a nutrient-poor, clearcut forestry-drained peatland. First, we measured instantaneous gas fluxes (gÂ m-2Â h-1) of the microsite types (unprepared, mound, pit, scalp) within a given treatment plot (control, mounding, scalping) in order to estimate their annual rates (gÂ m-2Â a-1). Then, we estimated annual flux rates for each treatment comprehensively by considering the surface area-based distribution of microsite types in the corresponding treatment plot, and finally, the overall climatic impact of GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (100-year GWP) 2-3Â years after clearcutting and soil preparation. Compared to the control microsites, instantaneous CO2 emissions from scalps and pits were lower while those from mounds equivalent. However, increased CO2 emissions from the unprepared microsites within prepared plots were observed in respect to those of the control. Comprehensively, the annual CO2 emission rates differed little between treatments, ranging between 929 and 1078Â gÂ m-2Â a-1. Hence, neither mounding nor scalping accelerated annual SRp relative to the control treatment. Annual fluxes of CH4 were dependent on the position of the water table. In our wet block, the mounding treatment led to the greatest annual CH4 emissions (3.62Â gÂ m-2Â a-1), followed by the control (2.14Â gÂ m-2Â a-1) and scalping (1.05Â gÂ m-2Â a-1); in the dry block, however, only the scalping treatment was a net, though minimal, source of CH4 (0.80Â gÂ m-2Â a-1) while the other two treatments effectively consumed CH4 (mounding -0.16Â gÂ m-2Â a-1; control -0.05Â gÂ m-2Â a-1). Though annual N2O emission levels were low (0.05-0.08Â gÂ m-2Â a-1), both soil preparation treatments increased the flux of N2O from peat soil compared to the control. When considering the fluxes of all three greenhouse gases, the cumulative impact of soil preparation (mounding or scalping) on the global warming potential of the nutrient-poor, clearcut peatland forest was negligible in respect to the control.",

Biomass and C stocks of above- and belowground live and dead tree biomass, understorey and forest ground vegetation, forest floor C (LFH-layer), and woody debris were determined from plot-level inventories and destructive tree sampling.

The contribution of individual NPP and respiration component fluxes varied considerably across the age-sequence, introducing different levels of uncertainty. Biometric and EC-based estimates both suggested that annual NPP, GPP, RE, and NEP were greatest at the 19-year-old site. Four-year mean values of NEP(B) and NEP(EC) were similar at the 6-year-old seedling (77 and 66Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1) and the 69-year-old mature site (135 and 124Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1), but differed considerably at the 19-year-old (439 and 736Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1) and the 34-year-old sites (170 and 392Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1). Both methods suggested similar patterns for inter-annual variability in GPP and NEP. Multi-year convergence of NEP(B) and NEP(EC) was not observed over the study period. Ecosystem C use efficiency was correlated to both forest NEP(EC) and NPP(B) suggesting that high productive forests (e.g. middle-age stands) were more efficient in sequestering C compared to low productive forests (e.g. seedling and mature stands). Similarly, negative and positive relationships of forest productivity with the total belowground C flux (TBCF) to GPP ratio and with the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration (RA:RH), respectively, determined inter-annual and inter-site differences in C allocation. Integrating NEP across the age-sequence resulted in a total net C sequestration of 137 and 229Â tÂ CÂ ha-1 over the initial 70 years as estimated by the biometric and EC method, respectively. Total ecosystem C sequestered in biomass at the 69-year-old site suggested an accumulation of 160Â tÂ CÂ ha-1. These three estimates resulted in a mean C sequestration of 175Â Â±Â 48Â tÂ CÂ ha-1. This study demonstrates that comparing estimates from independent methods is imperative to constrain C budgets and C dynamics in forest ecosystems.",

The 4-year (2004-2008) mean annual carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanges, based on biometric and eddy covariance data, were combined with the 2-year means of static chamber measurements of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes (2006-2007) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export below 1 m soil depth (2004-2005). The total ecosystem C pool increased with age from 46 to 197 t C ha-1 across the four stands. Rates of organic matter cycling (i.e. litterfall and decomposition) were similar among the three older stands. In contrast, considerable differences related to stand age and site quality were observed in the magnitude and partitioning of individual CO2 fluxes, showing a peak in production and respiration rates in the middle-age (20-year-old) stand growing on fertile post-agricultural soil. The DOC export accounted for 10% of net ecosystem production (NEP) at the 7-year-old stand but <2% at the three older stands. The GHG balance from the combined exchanges of CO2, CH4 and N2O was 2.6, 21.6, 13.5 and 4.8 t CO2 equivalent ha-1 year-1 for the 7-, 20-, 35- and 70-year-old stands, respectively. The maximum annual contribution from the combined exchanges of CH4 and N2O to the GHG balance was 13 and 8% in the 7- and 70-year-old stands, respectively, but <1% in the two highly productive middle-age (20- and 35-year-old) stands. Averaged over the entire age sequence, the CO2 exchange was the main driver of the GHG balance in these forests. The cumulative CO2 sequestration over the 70 years was estimated at 129 t C and 297 t C ha-1 year-1 for stands growing on low- and high-productivity sites, respectively. This study highlights the importance of accounting for age and site quality effects on forest C and GHG balances. It further demonstrates a large potential for net C sequestration and climate benefits gained through afforestation of marginal agricultural and fallow lands in temperate regions. ",

The stable isotopic composition of ecosystem respiration (d13CR and d18OR) is used in inversion models to quantify regional patterns of CO2 sources and sinks, but models are limited by sparse measurements in tropical regions. We measured soil respiration rates, concentrations of CO2, CH4, CO, N2O and H2 and the isotopic composition of CO2, CH4 and H2 at four heights in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) above three common land-use types in central Panama, during dry and rainy seasons. Soil respiration rates were lowest in Plantation (average 3.4 Âµmol m-2 s-1), highest in Pasture (8.3 Âµmol m-2 s-1) and intermediate in Rainforest (5.2 Âµmol m-2 s-1). d13CR closely reflected land use and increased during the dry season where C3 vegetation was present. d18OR did not differ by land use but was lower during the rainy than the dry season. CO2 was correlated with other species in approximately half of the NBL profiles, allowing us to estimate trace gas fluxes that were generally within the range of literature values. The Rainforest soil was a sink for CH4 but emissions were observed in Pasture and Plantation, especially during the wet season. N2O emissions were higher in Pasture and Plantation than Rainforest, contrary to expectations. Soil H2 uptake was highest in Rainforest and was not observable in Pasture and Plantation during the wet season. We observed soil CO uptake during the dry season and emissions during the wet season across land-use types. This study demonstrated that strong impacts of land-use change on soil-atmosphere trace gas exchange can be detected in the NBL, and provides useful observational constraints for top-down and bottom-up biogeochemistry models.

In seasonally dry climates (Mediterranean), droughts result from reductions in annual rainfall and changes in rain seasonality. We compared carbon fluxes measured by the eddy covariance technique in three contrasting ecosystems in southern Portugal: an evergreen oak woodland (savannah-like) with ca.~21% tree crown cover, a grassland dominated by herbaceous annuals and a coppiced short-rotation eucalyptus plantation. During the experimental period (2003-2006) the eucalyptus plantation was always the strongest sink for carbon: net ecosystem exchange rate (NEE) between -861 and -399 g C m-2 year-1. The oak woodland and the grassland were much weaker sinks for carbon: NEE varied in the oak woodland between -140 and -28 g C m-2 year-1 and in the grassland between -190 and +49 g C m-2 year-1. The eucalyptus stand had higher GPP and a lower proportion of GPP spent in respiration than the other systems. The higher GPP resulted from high leaf area duration (LAD), as a surrogate for the photosynthetic photon flux density absorbed by the canopy. The eucalyptus had also higher rain use efficiency (GPP per unit of rain volume) and light use efficiency (the daily GPP per unit incident photosynthetic photon flux density) than the other two ecosystems. The effects of a severe drought could be evaluated during the hydrological-year (i.e., from October to September) of 2004-2005. Between October 2004 and June 2005 the precipitation was only 40% of the long-term average. In 2004-2005 all ecosystems had GPP lower than in wetter years and carbon sequestration was strongly restricted (less negative NEE). The grassland was a net source of carbon dioxide (+49 g C m-2 year-1). In the oak woodland a large proportion of GPP resulted from carbon assimilated by its annual vegetation component, which was strongly affected by the shortage of rain in winter. Overall, severe drought affected more GPP than Reco leading to the deterioration of NEE. Although the rain-use efficiency of the eucalyptus plantation increased in the dry year, this was not the case of evergreen oak woodland, which rain-use efficiency was not influenced by drought. Recovery after drought alleviation, i.e., beginning with heavy rain in October 2005, was fully accomplished in 2006 in the oak woodland and grassland, but slow in the eucalyptus plantation. ",

We sampled Rs monthly for three years in two adjacent plots, one left as control in natural condition, and one afforested with Acacia saligna. Sampling occurred 3-6 years after afforestation. Soil temperature (Ts) was a good predictor of Rs on certain periods of the year, although we could not relate this to specific levels of soil moisture (<U+03B8>). Seasonal Rs variation related more to <U+03B8> than to Ts, which could be explained by extremely low annual precipitation (138Â mm), concentrated during winter months. The correlation between Ts and Rs was higher when measured under plants compared to bare ground. The afforested site had in average 17% lower annual Rs (pÂ =Â 0.06) than the control site. During some months of the third year of measurements, the afforested site showed greater Rs than the control, suggesting that in the near future, Rs might be higher for the afforested site than for the natural condition, depending on the effect that trees may have on soil carbon stability, temperature and hydrological conditions.",

SR was consistently higher in the upland plots than at the wetland margin during the late summer/early fall. Seasonal and diel hystereses with respect to soil temperatures were of sufficient magnitude to prevent quantification of the influence of soil moisture, although apparent short-term responses of SR to precipitation occurred. Calculations of annual cumulative SR illustrated a decreasing trend in SR over the 5 year period, which were correlated with decreasing springtime mean soil temperatures. Spring soil temperatures decreased despite rising air temperatures over the same period, possibly as an effect of earlier leaf expansion and shading. The synchronous decrease in spring soil temperatures and SR during regional warming of air temperatures may represent a negative feedback on a warming climate by reducing CO2 production from soils. SR reached a maximum later in the year than total ecosystem respiration (ER) measured at a nearby eddy covariance flux tower, and the seasonality of their temperature response patterns were roughly opposite. SR, particularly in the upland, exceeded ER in the late summer/early fall in each year, suggesting that areas of lower efflux such as the wetland may be significant in the flux tower footprint or that long-term bias in either estimate may create a mismatch. Annual estimates of ER decreased over the same period and were highly correlated with SR. ",

We examined the changes in carbon (C) pools (trees, herbaceous vegetation, litter, coarse woody debris (CWD), and mineral topsoil at 0-10Â cm depth) and fluxes (decomposition of CWD and litter, as well as soil respiration) both through time and among diversity levels. Between 2001 and 2009 the aboveground C pools increased, driven by trees. Across diversity levels, the mean observed aboveground C pool was 7.9Â Â±Â 2.5Â MgÂ ha-1 in 2006 and 20.4Â Â±Â 7.4Â MgÂ ha-1 in 2009, a 158% increase. There was no significant diversity effect on the observed aboveground C pool, but we found a significant decrease in the topsoil C pool, with a mean value of 34.5Â Â±Â 2.4Â MgÂ ha-1 in 2001 and of 25.7Â Â±Â 5.7Â MgÂ ha-1 in 2009 (F1,36Â =Â 52.12, pÂ <Â 0.001). Assuming that the biomass C pool in 2001 was negligible (<1Â MgÂ ha-1), then the plantation gained in C, on average, ~20 and lost ~9Â MgÂ ha-1 in biomass and soil respectively, for an overall gain of ~11Â MgÂ ha-1 over 8 years. Across the entire data set, we uncovered significant effects of diversity on CWD decomposition (diversity: F2,393Â =Â 15.93, pÂ <Â 0.001) and soil respiration (monocultures vs mixtures: tÂ =Â 15.35, dfÂ =Â 11, pÂ <Â 0.05) and a marginally significant timeÂ xÂ diversity interaction on the loss of total C from the mineral topsoil pool (see above). Monthly CWD decomposition was significantly faster in monocultures (35.0Â Â±Â 24.1%) compared with triplets (31.3Â Â±Â 21.0%) and six-species mixtures (31.9Â Â±Â 26.8%), while soil respiration was higher in monocultures than in mixtures (tÂ =Â 15.35, dfÂ =Â 11, pÂ <Â 0.001). Path analyses showed that, as diversity increases, the links among the C pools and fluxes strengthen significantly. Our results demonstrate that tree diversity influences the processes governing the changes in C pools and fluxes following establishment of a tree plantation on a former pasture. We conclude that the choice of tree mixtures for afforestation in the tropics can have a marked influence on C pools and dynamics.",

Total net ecosystem production (NEP) was nearly 20Â tÂ CÂ m-2 during the 6-year study and annual NEP for each phenological year (April-March) increased annually from 107 to 467Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1. Although this ecosystem was productive during all parts of each year, greatest absolute values of daytime NEE (NEEdayÂ max) were -12.0 to -16.0Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 in the summertime when leaf area, air temperature and soil moisture peaked. NEEdayÂ max decreased in magnitude to its lowest point in March when leaf area was lowest, and ranged between -7.6 and -9.8Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1. Mean monthly nighttime NEE (NEEnight) was between 2.0 and 6.9Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1 in the winter and summer, respectively, and was controlled primarily by temperature. Variation in seasonal NEP in this ecosystem occurred in three distinct phases. The first phase occurred in April through May with the emergence of new leaves and when soil respiration was low; daily carbon assimilation (1.0-2.4Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â day-1) was greatest during this 2-month period during which an average 38% of annual C assimilation occurred. During the second phase, June-September, the rate of carbon uptake (0.8-1.6Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â day-1) was dependent mainly on variation in temperature, precipitation and VPD; on average, only 12% of annual carbon assimilation occurred during these 4 months and in dry years (2000 and 2001), the ecosystem was a carbon source during this period. During the third phase, October-March, daily carbon assimilation (0.3-1.1Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â day-1) was intermediate between the first two phases, and accounted for nearly 50% of annual carbon accumulated during these 6 months. While mean daily NEP was highest in spring, NEEday reached its greatest intensity in summer. In order of importance, PPFD, temperature, SWC, LAI, and VPD regulated NEEday. Temperature and SWC were the main environmental variables controlling soil respiration, which was more than 85% of ecosystem respiration. Scrub oak represents a unique ecosystem in the southeastern US and within the Ameriflux network. These results are unique in establishing the role scrub oak plays in landscape and regional carbon budgets of this subtropical, evergreen, fire dependent and highly active ecosystem.",

We studied the effects of thinning, a common management technique in many forest types, on age-related trends in C stocks using a chronosequence of thinned and unmanaged red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands ranging from 9 to 306 years old. Live tree C stocks increased with age to a maximum near the middle of the chronosequence in unmanaged stands, and increased across the entire chronosequence in thinned stands. C in live understory vegetation and C in the mineral soil each declined rapidly with age in young stands but changed relatively little in middle-aged to older stands regardless of management. Forest floor C stocks increased with age in unmanaged stands, but forest floor C decreased with age after the onset of thinning around age 40 in thinned stands. Deadwood C was highly variable, but decreased with age in thinned stands. Total ecosystem C increased with stand age until approaching an asymptote around age 150. The increase in total ecosystem C was paralleled by an age-related increase in total aboveground C, but relatively little change in total belowground C. Thinning had surprisingly little impact on total ecosystem C stocks, but it did modestly alter age-related trends in total ecosystem C allocation between aboveground and belowground pools. In addition to characterizing the subtle differences in C dynamics between thinned and unmanaged stands, these results suggest that C accrual in red pine stands continues well beyond the 60-100 year management rotations typical for this system. Management plans that incorporate longer rotations and thinning in some stands could play an important role in maximizing C stocks in red pine forests while meeting other objectives including timber extraction, biodiversity conservation, restoration, and fuel reduction goals.

The objectives of this study were: to understand how soil respiration responded to the experimental treatments; to determine whether fine-root biomass was correlated to rates of soil respiration; and to measure rates of fine-root turnover in aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests and determine whether root turnover might be driving patterns in soil respiration. â€¢ Soil respiration was measured, root biomass was determined, and estimates of root production, mortality and biomass turnover were made. â€¢ Soil respiration was greatest in the +CO2 and +CO2Â +O3 treatments across all three plant communities. Soil respiration was correlated with increases in fine-root biomass. In the aspen community, annual fine-root production and mortality (gÂ m-2) were positively affected by +O3. â€¢ After 10Â yr of exposure, +CO2Â +O3-induced increases in belowground carbon allocation suggest that the positive effects of elevated CO2 on belowground net primary productivity (NPP) may not be offset by negative effects of O3. For the aspen community, fine-root biomass is actually stimulated by +O3, and especially +CO2Â +O3. ",

Three treatments were applied: litter exclusion (E), control (C, natural amount: 486Â gÂ m-2) and litter addition (A, twice the natural amount: 972Â gÂ m-2).Litter decomposition rate was not affected by fresh litter amount. However, the addition or exclusion of fresh litter quickly increased or decreased total soil CO2 efflux (FS) significantly, but the relative contribution of fresh litter to total soil respiration remained unchanged between the C and A treatments, as determined by laboratory measurements. Variation in FS among treatments was not related to modification of its temperature sensitivity which was not affected by fresh litter amount (Q10: 3.5 for E, 3.2 for C, 3.6 for A). While litter exclusion was the main cause of the FS decrease in the E treatment, only 68% of FS was directly attributable to litter addition in the A treatment. The remaining 32% of FS in the A treatment was related to a real priming effect that appeared to be a long-lasting phenomenon. This priming effect lasting over 1 year may be related to a continuous release of organic compounds from litter to soil because of the progressive decomposition of leaf litter. Q10 estimates and isotopic data lead to the hypothesis that the priming effect corresponded to the activation of the whole soil system.As a consequence, the increase in ecosystem productivity may lead, via an increase in the amount of litter, to an increase in carbon turnover in soil. Further labelling experiments involving high-frequency carbon stable isotope measurements of CO2 efflux would help to clarify the relative importance of bulk soil and rhizosphere in the priming effect.",

Here we present the first intensive study of trace gas fluxes along an elevation sequence of tropical montane forests ranging from 1190 m to 2470 m elevation in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using chamber techniques, we measured monthly flux rates and controlling factors on three elevations, each with three replicate plots for 1 year. Annual N2O fluxes ranged from 0.29 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 1800 m to 1.01 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 2470 m and 1.11 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 1190 m, while annual NO fluxes ranged from 0.17 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 1800 m, to 0.18 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 2470 m and 0.48 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at 1190 m. Methane uptake ranged from 1.45 kg C ha-1 yr-1 at 2470 m to 2.45 kg C ha-1 yr-1 at 1190 m and 3.32 kg C ha-1 yr-1 at 1800 m. At the highest elevation, methane uptake was affected by the thick organic layer present at the surface of the soil. Several lines of evidence (soil N stocks, extractable inorganic N, litterfall mass, litterfall-N and d15N signals in litterfall and soil organic matter) show that the annual N2O + NO emissions could be explained by the inherent N status of these forests. In a test of indices of N cycling to explain N2O and NO fluxes, the robustness of litterfall C/N and litterfall N was confirmed and the d15N signal of litterfall emerged as promising driver for regional and global biogeochemical models that predict N2O + NO emissions from soil.

In this study, we characterize the spatial trends in carbon storage and fluxes in both live and dead biomass (necromass) in two Amazonian forests, the Biological Dynamic of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), near Manaus, Amazonas, and the Tapajos National Forest (TNF) near Santarem, Para. We assessed coarse woody debris (CWD) stocks, tree growth, mortality, and recruitment in ground-based plots distributed across the terra firme forest at both sites. Carbon dynamics were similar within each site, but differed significantly between the sites. The BDFFP and the TNF held comparable live biomass (167 Â± 7.6 MgCÂ·ha-1 versus 149 Â± 6.0 MgCÂ·ha-1, respectively), but stocks of CWD were 2.5 times larger at TNF (16.2 Â± 1.5 MgCÂ·ha-1 at BDFFP, versus 40.1 Â± 3.9 MgCÂ·ha-1 at TNF). A model of current forest dynamics suggests that the BDFFP was close to carbon balance, and its size class structure approximated a steady state. The TNF, by contrast, showed rapid carbon accrual to live biomass (3.24 Â± 0.22 MgCÂ·ha-1Â·a-1 in TNF, 2.59 Â± 0.16 MgCÂ·ha-1Â·a-1 in BDFFP), which was more than offset by losses from large stocks of CWD, as well as ongoing shifts of biomass among size classes. This pattern in the TNF suggests recovery from a significant disturbance. The net loss of carbon from the TNF will likely last 10-15 years after the initial disturbance (controlled by the rate of decay of coarse woody debris), followed by uptake of carbon as the forest size class structure and composition continue to shift. The frequency and longevity of forests showing such disequilibruim dynamics within the larger matrix of the Amazon remains an essential question to understanding Amazonian carbon balance. ",

Our objective was to quantify the effects of elevation (primarily temperature) on ecosystem properties during primary succession, as a key to understanding ecosystem-climate interactions. Four study sites were on 111- to 136-yr-old lava flows at elevations of 290, 700, 1130, and 1660 m. Two additional sites on 3400-yr-old lava were at 700 and 1660 m elevations. All sites were on solid pahoehoe (smooth or ropy-textured) lava substrates with gentle relief, were free of significant human disturbance, received abundant precipitation, and had similar vegetation composition. Total aboveground biomass, soil organic matter mass, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) were all greater in the old sites than in young sites. Differences between young and old sites in aboveground live biomass, detrital mass, and ANPP all supported the conclusion that ecosystem development proceeded relatively faster at 700 m elevation than at 1660 m. However, aboveground biomass in the old sites (81 Mg/ha at 1660 m elevation and 123 Mg/ha at 700 m) was low in comparison with other wet tropical forests. Accumulations of N and P in live biomass and detritus followed the same trends as were observed for organic matter. Rates of soil carbon accumulation over the first 3400 yr of succession averaged 2.1 gÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, similar to other reported soil chronosequences. Observed rates of N accumulation ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 gÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 over the first 136 yr of succession. There were no monotonic elevational trends among young sites with respect to live biomass, detritus mass, or total N or P accumulation. Foliar nitrogen concentrations in the young sites were among the lowest reported from any tropical forests and tended to decline with increasing elevation. The growth and biomass of individual plant species varied in distinctive ways along the elevational gradient. Nevertheless, among young sites there was a direct, linear relationship between total ANPP and mean annual temperature of the site, with a similar pattern in the two old sites. For each 1Â°C increase in mean annual temperature, total ANPP increased by 54 gÂ·m-2Â·yr-1. Community-level ANPP also was directly correlated with rates of N and P uptake by the vegetation, regardless of site age or elevation. ",

Here, we compare results from mature forest and nearby 15-20 year old tree plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate differences in allocation of carbon to aboveground production and root systems. We found that the tree plantations, which had fully developed, closed canopies, allocated more carbon belowground - to their root systems - than did mature forest. This increase in belowground carbon allocation correlated significantly with aboveground tree growth but not with canopy production (i.e., leaf fall or fine litter production). In contrast, there were no correlations between canopy production and either tree growth or belowground carbon allocation. Enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake, providing nutrients beyond those required for the production of short-lived tissues such as leaves and fine roots, and thus enabling biomass accumulation. Our analyses support this deduction at our site, showing that enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can be an important mechanism promoting biomass accumulation during forest growth in the moist tropics. Identifying factors that control when, where and for how long this occurs would help us to improve models of forest growth and nutrient cycling, and to ascertain the role that young forests play in mitigating increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.

In the tropical Americas, mature dry tropical forest is rapidly being converted to secondary forest during the fallow period of shifting cultivation. This study addresses changes in forest biomass during forest recovery following shifting cultivation of maize (corn) in the Southern Yucatan Peninsular Region (SYPR), Mexico. We sampled stems >1 cm diameter at breast height at 36 study sites in three regions located along a precipitation gradient of 900-1400 mm/yr. Using allometric equations developed in the tropical Americas, we estimated total aboveground (TAG) biomass of trees, palms, and lianas. Biomass differed little between regions when considering forests of a given age. Over the entire area, forest biomass increased rapidly during succession, from 20.9 Mg/ha in 2-5-yr-old forests to 136.4 Mg/ha in mature forests (logged in the past half century, but not cultivated). Within 12-25 yr, biomass reached half of mature forest levels, and we estimate recovery to pre-cultivation levels in 55-95 yr. Recovery to a pre-logged state may take 65-120 yr. In mature forests, the contribution of stems 1-4.9 cm dbh was consequential, comprising 15% of TAG biomass. Trends in both TAG biomass and basal area were driven by the contribution of trees, although in a few sites, the importance of palms and lianas to forest structure and biomass was considerable. Our results suggest that forest biomass in secondary dry tropical forests of the SYPR is profoundly influenced by forest age, and less so by annual precipitation, while variability in forest structure depends more on differences in water availability and recent human disturbance.

In particular, we analyse the effect of the extrapolation of night-time values of ecosystem respiration into the daytime; this is usually done with a temperature response function that is derived from long-term data sets. For this analysis, we used 16 one-year-long data sets of carbon dioxide exchange measurements from European and US-American eddy covariance networks. These sites span from the boreal to Mediterranean climates, and include deciduous and evergreen forest, scrubland and crop ecosystems. We show that the temperature sensitivity of Reco, derived from long-term (annual) data sets, does not reflect the short-term temperature sensitivity that is effective when extrapolating from night- to daytime. Specifically, in summer active ecosystems the long-term temperature sensitivity exceeds the short-term sensitivity. Thus, in those ecosystems, the application of a long-term temperature sensitivity to the extrapolation of respiration from night to day leads to a systematic overestimation of ecosystem respiration from half-hourly to annual time-scales, which can reach >25% for an annual budget and which consequently affects estimates of GEP. Conversely, in summer passive (Mediterranean) ecosystems, the long-term temperature sensitivity is lower than the short-term temperature sensitivity resulting in underestimation of annual sums of respiration. We introduce a new generic algorithm that derives a short-term temperature sensitivity of Reco from eddy covariance data that applies this to the extrapolation from night- to daytime, and that further performs a filling of data gaps that exploits both, the covariance between fluxes and meteorological drivers and the temporal structure of the fluxes. While this algorithm should give less biased estimates of GEP and Reco, we discuss the remaining biases and recommend that eddy covariance measurements are still backed by ancillary flux measurements that can reduce the uncertainties inherent in the eddy covariance data.

Species richness increased rapidly over time but equitability and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index declined with succession. Plant densities of herb, shrub, sapling, and tree strata increased, then decreased, in successive waves as the vegetation increased in height. Basal area (stems >5.1 cm dbh) initially increased exponentially, then linearly after the 5th yr to attain a total of 18.7 m2/ha by the 20th yr. Primary productivity also increased exponentially at first, but then increased linearly through the 20th yr at which time annual aboveground primary productivity was 20 Mg/ha. Aboveground biomass increased linearly after the 5th yr until by the 20th yr it was 52 Mg/ha, 38% of the reference forest biomass. Aboveground nutrient pools of some elements accumulated faster than biomass by the 20th yr when calculated as percentages of the 55-yr-old reference forest pools and biomass. These included: potassium-52%, phosphorus-44%, magnesium-42%. Other accumulated more slowly than biomass: sulfur-32%, and nitrogen and calcium each-29%. While recovery rate on Watershed 2 was delayed in the first decade of regrowth, and composition was somewhat altered because of the 3-yr suppression, this forest nevertheless displayed a vigorous capacity for regeneration after suppression ceased.

During this time, the WLEF region was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere averaging 120Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1, with a range of interannual variability of 140Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1. Random uncertainty in annual sums of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) due to turbulent variability and gap-filling was estimated to be 15-20Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1. Although magnitudes of NEE sums were affected systematically by the choice of friction velocity (u*) threshold, this choice had little effect on interannual variability of annual sums. The WLEF region was, on average, a source of carbon from 1997 to 2004 regardless of the u* threshold applied. Interannually, daytime NEE sums varied more than nighttime NEE sums, and spring and summer NEE sums varied more than autumn and winter NEE sums. Interannual variations in seasonal sums of daytime, nighttime and total NEE were often strongly correlated with changes in soil moisture and soil temperature. Standard nonlinear gap-filling regression models of respiration and gross ecosystem productivity were extended to incorporate the effects of soil moisture and phenology and combined into a single model of NEE. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) data assimilation technique was performed using observed WLEF NEE to derive full probability density functions (PDFs) of time-invariant model parameters. Prior values had little effect on posterior parameter PDFs, but significant differences in parameter PDFs occurred depending on whether daytime NEE, nighttime NEE, or total NEE data were used. This simple model was moderately successful in producing statistically significant correlations with interannual variations in annual and growing season NEE sums, but was generally unsuccessful in spring and autumn. In all cases, the model underestimated the degree of variability in NEE sums.",

We surveyed 19.75 ha along four 1-km transects of well-drained old-growth upland forest in the Tapajos National Forest near Santarem, Para, Brazil (2Â°51' S, 54Â°58' W) in order to assess carbon pool sizes, fluxes, and climatic controls on carbon balance. In 1999 there were, on average, 470 live trees per hectare with diameter at breast height (dbh) =10 cm. The mean (and 95% ci) aboveground live biomass was 143.7 Â± 5.4 Mg C/ha, with an additional 48.0 Â± 5.2 Mg C/ha of coarse woody debris (CWD). The increase of live wood biomass after two years was 1.40 Â± 0.62 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, the net result of growth (3.18 Â± 0.20 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 from mean bole increment of 0.36 cm/yr), recruitment of new trees (0.63 Â± 0.09 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, reflecting a notably high stem recruitment rate of 4.8 Â± 0.9%), and mortality (-2.41 Â± 0.53 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 from stem death of 1.7% yr-1). The gain in live wood biomass was exceeded by respiration losses from CWD, resulting in an overall estimated net loss from total aboveground biomass of 1.9 Â± 1.0 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1. The presence of large CWD pools, high recruitment rate, and net accumulation of small-tree biomass, suggest that a period of high mortality preceded the initiation of this study, possibly triggered by the strong El Nino Southern Oscillation events of the 1990s. Transfer of carbon between live and dead biomass pools appears to have led to substantial increases in the pool of CWD, causing the observed net carbon release. The data show that biometric studies of tropical forests neglecting CWD are unlikely to accurately determine carbon balance. Furthermore, the hypothesized sequestration flux from CO2 fertilization (<0.5 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1) would be comparatively small and masked for considerable periods by climate-driven shifts in forest structure and associated carbon balance in tropical forests.

In tropical savannas seasonal moisture availability and frequent fires drive ecosystem dynamics and may have a considerable impact on soil carbon (C) cycling, including Rs. In order to test the effect of fire on soil C cycling we measured Rs in annually burnt and unburnt plots in wet and dry seasons at a long-term fire experiment established in savanna woodlands of northern Australia. There was a significant interaction between season and fire, with highest rates of daily Rs (722Â mmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â d-1) observed in the wet season on unburnt, leaf litter patches. The three fold higher Rs rate on unburnt plots in the wet season was due to greater root-derived respiration (Rroot: 356Â mmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â d-1), while smaller changes to soil-derived respiration (Rsoil: 51Â mmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â d-1) were simply the result of C moving through decomposition rather than combustion pathways. Relationships between instantaneous Rs and soil temperature showed hysteresis with variable direction, suggesting that season and fire treatment also influence the soil depth at which CO2 is produced. We suggest that (1) changes to fire regimes, through active management or climate change, in tropical savannas could have an impact on Rs, and (2) the direct effect of fire on soil C cycling is limited to the removal of aboveground litter inputs.",

Here, we use a statistical modeling approach to partition the interannual variability in NEE (and its component fluxes, ecosystem respiration, Reco, and gross photosynthesis, Pgross) into two main effects: variation in environmental drivers (air and soil temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water content) and variation in the biotic response to this environmental forcing (as characterized by the model parameters). The model is applied to a 9-year data set from the Howland AmeriFlux site, a spruce-dominated forest in Maine, USA. Gap-filled flux measurements at this site indicate that the forest has been sequestering, on average, 190 g C m-2 yr-1, with a range from 130 to 270 g C m-2 yr-1. Our fitted model predicts somewhat more uptake (mean 270 g C m-2 yr-1), but interannual variation is similar, and wavelet variance analyses indicate good agreement between tower measurements and model predictions across a wide range of timescales (hours to years). Associated with the interannual variation in NEE are clear differences among years in model parameters for both Reco and Pgross. Analysis of model predictions suggests that, at the annual time step, about 40% of the variance in modeled NEE can be attributed to variation in environmental drivers, and 55% to variation in the biotic response to this forcing. As model predictions are aggregated at longer timescales (from individual days to months to calendar year), variation in environmental drivers becomes progressively less important, and variation in the biotic response becomes progressively more important, in determining the modeled flux. There is a strong negative correlation between modeled annual Pgross and Reco (r=-0.93, P=0.001); two possible explanations for this correlation are discussed. The correlation promotes homeostasis of NEE: the interannual variation in modeled NEE is substantially less than that for either Pgross or Reco ",

Results indicate that subsurface CO2 production is very sensitive to the subsurface thermal regime, where relationships were robust and also stable across all land use types studied. In contrast, the thermal dependence of surface CO2 flux was much weaker. We found that soil heat content, rather than soil temperature, was the most descriptive index of the biological processes contributing to soil profile CO2 production at our study sites. Soil moisture was also found to have an important influence on subsurface CO2 production, particularly because of the relationship between moisture and soil profile diffusivity. Nondiffusive profile CO2 transport also appears to be important at these sites where the subsurface controls on transport change regularly and markedly. ",

Aims: To present the first comprehensive description of the impact of repeated low intensity, understorey fire on carbon cycling in a semi-deciduous, seasonally dry tropical forest on infertile soil in south-eastern Amazonia. Methods: We compared an annually burnt forest plot with a control plot over a three-year period (2009-2011). For each plot we quantified the components of net primary productivity (NPP), autotrophic (R a) and heterotrophic respiration (R h), and estimated total plant carbon expenditure (PCE, the sum of NPP and R a) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE, the quotient of NPP/PCE). Results: Total NPP and R a were 15 and 4% lower on the burnt plot than on the control, respectively. Both plots were characterised by a slightly higher CUE of 0.36-0.39, compared to evergreen lowland Amazon forests. Conclusions: These measurements provide the first evidence of a distinctive pattern of carbon cycling within this transitional forest. Overall, regular understorey fire is shown to have little impact on ecosystem-level carbon fluxes. ",

Soil CO2 fluxes were measured at each site every 15-20 days with a closed dynamic system (LI-COR 6400) using soil collars from spring 2000 to spring 2002. At the same time, soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm and soil water content (m3 m-3) were measured at each collar. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 30 cm and stones, root content and bulk density were determined in order to obtain reliable estimates of carbon content per unit area (kg C m-2). Soil respiration and temperature data were fitted with a simple logistic model separately for each site, so that base respiration rates and mean annual soil respiration were estimated. Then the same regression model was applied to all sites simultaneously, with each model parameter being expressed as a linear function of site variables. The general model explained about 86% of the intersite variability of soil respiration. In particular, soil mean annual temperature explained the most of the variance of the model (0.41), followed by soil temperature interquartlile range (0.24), soil carbon content (0.16) and soil water content (0.05).

In the present study, a development of this indirect methodology is presented by taking into consideration both the temporal variation and the spatial heterogeneity of heterotrophic respiration. For this purpose, soil CO2 efflux, soil carbon content and main stand characteristics were estimated in seven evergreen forest ecosystems along an elevation gradient ranging from 250 to 1740Â m. For each site and for each sampling date the measured soil CO2 efflux (R S) was predicted with the model R S = a xÂ S C + b xÂ R D Â± e, where S C is soil carbon content per unit area to a depth of 30Â cm and R D is the root density of the 2-5Â mm root class. Regressions with statistically significant a and b coefficients allowed the indirect separation of the two components of soil CO2 efflux. Considering that the different sampling dates were characterized by different soil temperature, it was possible to investigate the temporal and thermal dependency of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. It was estimated that annual autotrophic respiration accounts for 16-58% of total soil CO2 efflux in the seven different evergreen ecosystems. In addition, our observations show a decrease of annual autotrophic respiration at increasing availability of soil nitrogen.",

Monitoring soil carbon dioxide efflux is a complex task, due to the high spatial and temporal variability of the fluxes. For this reason, more than 30 sampling points are required to attain reliable estimates of ecosystem soil respiration. However, the number of sampled points is often limited by labour, time and budget constraints. Stratified sampling is an alternative to random sampling as a method to reduce the number of sampling points when an effective proxy variable is available for the definition of the strata.In order to evaluate different sampling strategies we tested, with a Monte Carlo simulation, the effectiveness of random and stratified samplings, using experimental data collected in three alpine ecosystems (two forests and one grassland). We evaluated an innovative method for defining the strata to be sampled. The method is based on an initial sampling of soil respiration from a large number of candidate points in order to account for the spatial variability. The minimum number of sampling points required to adequately represent soil respiration for the entire area were then selected using stratified statistical sampling. We show that this method is unbiased and that it reduces considerably the uncertainty in the sampling process compared to random sampling. The method was highly effective in the two forest ecosystems, characterized by a high spatial variability in soil respiration and by a high temporal correlation of the fluxes. On the contrary the method was not so effective in the grassland site, where fluxes have lower spatial variability and temporal correlation. However, the stratified sampling offered a consistent reduction of the error (%) of the estimated annual soil CO2 efflux in all the ecosystems. At the grassland ecosystem the average reduction of the error (%) of the annual CO2 efflux was about 12%, while at the forest ecosystems the average reductions were 55% and 57%, respectively.",

The climate is of Mediterranean type with a long term (1961-1990) annual average precipitation of 709Â mm and an annual average air temperature of 15.90Â Â°C.

We analyzed the daily, seasonal and inter-annual variation of carbon uptake and evapotranspiration, and their relationships with the events and the variability of the main meteorological variables.

For the same period, seasonal patterns of carbon uptake showed maximum values in April and decreased in July-August. The eucalypt stand recovered its carbon sink ability since June 2007 and had a NEE of -209.01Â gÂ CÂ m-2 in 2009. After the felling, the carbon uptake occurred from mid-February to mid-October, following an almost opposite pattern than that of the trees in the term of their productive cycle. A quantitative approach using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) was made for the period before the felling to relate monthly NEE and GPP with accumulated photosynthetic active radiation, water vapour pressure and precipitation.

We quantified the amount of C stored in aboveground plant biomass, standing dead timber, downed dead wood, surface organic soil, and mineral soil in 11 jack pine stands that had burned between 1 and 72 years previously. Total ecosystem C ranged from a low of 59 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 4-year-old stand to 110 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1 in the 72-year-old stand. Changes in total ecosystem C across the chronosequence conformed to theoretical predictions, in which C stocks declined initially as decomposition of dead wood and forest-floor C exceeded production by regenerating vegetation, and then increased asymptotically with the development of a new stand of jack pine. This pattern was well described by the following ""gamma"" function: total ecosystem C (MgÂ·ha<U+0096>1) = 112.2 <U+0096> 39.6 x age0.351 x exp(<U+0096>0.053 x age01.039); mean-corrected R2 = 0.976. Using the first derivative of this parameterized gamma function, we estimated that jack pine stands function as a weak source of C to the atmosphere for only ca. 6 years following wildfire, and reach a maximum net ecosystem productivity of 1.6 Mg CÂ·ha<U+0096>1Â·year<U+0096>1 by year 16. We attribute the rapid transition from carbon source to carbon sink in these ecosystems to two factors: (i) stand-replacing wildfires in these xeric forests leave behind little respirable substrate in surface organic horizons, and (ii) jack pine is able to rapidly reestablish following wildfires via serotinous cones. Jack pine stands remained net sinks for C across the chronosequence; however, net ecosystem productivity had declined to 0.12 C ha<U+0096>1Â·year<U+0096>1 by year 72. Carbon sequestration by mature jack pine ecosystems was driven primarily by continued growth of overstory jack pine, not by accumulation of detrital C.",

T represented 68% of E, close to the 75% of soil coverage by palms. The inter-annual variability was low for potential evapo-transpiration (ETo), energy and water fluxes. The seasonal variability was more pronounced, driven by radiation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The canopy conductance of coconut palms appeared to be strongly controlled by VPD.

The following changes occurred during secondary succession: (i) above- and below-ground aspen biomass increased, (ii) aboveground aspen production peaked between the ages of 18 and 32 years, (iii) the root to shoot ratio (R/S) of overstory aspen declined, (iv) the amounts and ecosystem proportions of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in the aspen overstory increased, and (v) the ecosystem proportions of nutrients in the understory declined. As the relative abundance of nutrients in overstory aspen increased, the labile nutrient pool in the mineral soil, particularly Mg and Ca, declined. The study suggests that understory roots play an important role in nutrient retention of successionary aspen stands in the upper Great Lakes region. Understory vegetation had an average R/S of 4.5 (compared with 0.18 to 0.58 for overstory aspen), with their small-root (< 0.3 cm) biomass comprising about 76% of the total ecosystem small-root pool. The proportion of nutrients in the living vegetation accounted for by the understory declined with stand age. However, from 13 to 24% of the total plant-available ecosystem amounts of nutrients resided in the understory of the 63-year-old stand. Relative to the ecosystem development model of Bormann and Likens, the reorganization phase in successionary aspen stands of the upper Great Lakes region may last 5 years or less. The aggradation phase lasts until about 70 years, after which time aspen is replaced by northern hardwoods.",

Therefore, we investigated daily, seasonal and annual soil respiration rates in a mixed forest (Lageren), located at about 700Â m in the Swiss Jura mountains, during 2Â years (2006 and 2007). Soil respiration (SR) was measured continuously with high temporal resolution (half-hourly) at one single point (SRautomated) and periodically with high spatial resolution (SRmanual) at 16 plots within the study site. Both, SRautomated and SRmanual showed a similar seasonal cycle. SR strongly depended on soil temperature in 2007 (R 2Â =Â 0.82-0.92), but less so in 2006 (R 2Â =Â 0.56-0.76) when SR was water limited during a summer drought. Including soil moisture improved the fit of the 2006 model significantly (R 2Â =Â 0.78-0.97). Total annual SR for the study site was estimated as 869Â g C m-2Â year-1 for 2006 and as 907Â g C m-2Â year-1 for 2007 (uncertainty <10% at the 95% confidence interval, determined by bootstrapping). Selected environmental conditions were assessed in more detail: (1) Rapid, but contrasting changes of SR were found after summer rainfall. Depending on soil moisture at pre-rain conditions, summer rain could either cause a pulse of CO2 from the soil or an abrupt decrease of SRautomated due to water logging of soil pores. (2) Two contrasting winter seasons resulted in SR being about 60-70% (31.2-44.6Â g C m-2) higher during a mild winter (2007) compared to a harsh winter (2006). (3) Analysing SR for selected periods on a diurnal scale revealed a counter-clockwise hysteresis with soil surface temperatures. This indication of a time-lagged response of SR to temperature was further supported by a very strong relationship (R 2Â =Â 0.86-0.90) of SR to soil temperature with a time-lag of 2-4Â h.",

Therefore, we partitioned soil respiration (SR) into microbial (MR) and root-rhizosphere respiration (RR) using small root exclusion treatments in a mixed mountain forest in Switzerland. In addition, fine root respiration (FRR) was determined with measurements of excised roots. RR and FRR were strongly related to each other (R2 = 0.92, n = 7), with RR contributing about 46% and FRR about 32% to total SR. RR rates increased more strongly with temperature (Q10 = 3.2) than MR rates (Q10 = 2.3). Since the contribution of RR to SR was found to be higher during growing (50%) than during dormant periods (40%), we separated the 2-year data set into phenophases. During the growing period of 2007, the temperature sensitivity of RR (Q10 = 2.5, R2 = 0.62) was similar to that of MR (Q10 = 2.2, R2 = 0.57). However, during the dormant period of 2006/2007, RR was not related to soil temperature (R2 = 0.44, n.s.), in contrast to MR (Q10 = 7.2; R2 = 0.92). To better understand the influence of plant activity on root respiration, we related RR and FRR rates to photosynthetic active radiation (both R2 = 0.67, n = 7, P = 0.025), suggesting increased root respiration rates during times with high photosynthesis. During foliage green-up in spring 2008, i.e., from bud break to full leaf expansion, RR increased by a factor of 5, while soil temperature increased only by about 5 Â°C, leading to an extraordinary high Q10 of 10.6; meanwhile, the contribution of RR to SR increased from 29 to 47%. This clearly shows that root respiration and its apparent temperature sensitivity highly depend on plant phenology and thus on canopy assimilation and carbon allocation belowground.",

However, differences in the water-sensitivity of component processes make carbon balance predictions challenging. To examine responses of ecosystem components to water limitations, we conducted a study of tree, soil and ecosystem-level processes in a young ponderosa pine stand under natural summer drought (control) and increased soil water conditions (watered). Weekly-averaged tree transpiration (Ttree), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GPP) and soil CO2 efflux (Rstree; nearby trees) were related with soil water content (SWC; polynomial form: TtreeR2Â =Â 0.98 and RstreeR2Â =Â 0.91, logarithmic form: GPP R2Â =Â 0.86) and declined rapidly when relative extractable soil water (REW) was <50%. The sensitivity of daily variations in canopy conductance (Gs) to vapor pressure deficit was affected by SWC (R2Â =Â 0.97; logarithmic function), decreasing at REW <50%. Watering maintained REW at about 70% in July and August but positively affected tree carbon and water dynamics only at the end of summer when fluxes in the control treatment were strongly water-limited. A tight coupling of above- and belowground fluxes became apparent. In the control treatment, root-rhizosphere respiration (Rr) decreased along with GPP and Ttree (R2Â =Â 0.58) as drought progressed, while watering maintained Rr, Ttree and Gs at a significantly higher level than those of the unwatered trees in late summer. In contrast, microbial respiration responded instantaneously and strongly to the watering compared to the control treatment. The net effect was that increased soil water availability during the typical dry growing season has a negative effect on the short-term seasonal ecosystem C balance due to a larger increase in decomposition than photosynthesis. However, longer-term effects remain uncertain. In summary, our study highlights that understanding the dissimilar response of tree dynamics and soil decomposition to water availability is a key component in predicting future C sequestration in water-limited forest ecosystems.",

(1) Using soil cores, fine root production ranged from 1574 Â± 76 kgâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1 in the upland white spruce (Piceaglauca (Moench) Voss) stand to 4386 Â± 322 kgâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1 in the floodplain balsam poplar (Populusbalsamifera L.) stand, accounting for 49% of total production for coniferous stands and 32% of total production for deciduous stands. Fine root turnover rates were higher in floodplain (0.90 Â± 0.06 year-1) stands than in upland (0.42 Â± 0.10 year-1) stands. Across all sites, the ratio of fine root turnover to litter fall averaged 2.2 for biomass and 2.8 for N. Both values were higher in floodplain stands than in upland stands, and in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands. (2) The C budget method showed that C allocation to fine roots varied from 150 to 425 g Câ€¢m-2â€¢year-1 and suggested that soil respiration was more dependent on C derived from roots than from aboveground inputs. The C allocation ratio (C to roots: C to litter fall) was inversely correlated with litter-fall C and varied from 0.3 to 69.5; there was a tendency for higher proportional belowground allocation in coniferous stands than in deciduous stands and the highest levels were at the earliest successional sites. (3) Estimates of apparent N uptake (Nu), N allocation to fine roots, and fine root production based on N budget calculations showed that annual aboveground N increments exceeded Nu estimates at half the sites, indicating that the method failed to account for large amounts of N acquired by plants. This suggests that plant and (or) mycorrhizal uptake of soil organic N may be more significant to ecosystem N cycling than mineral N turnover by the soil microbial biomass.",

To examine these issues in detail, major components of ecosystem carbon flux were studied in three mature black spruce forests in interior Alaska, where fine root production, respiration, mortality and decomposition, and aboveground production of trees, shrubs, and mosses were measured relative to soil CO2 fluxes. Fine root production, measured over a two-year period using minirhizotrons, varied from 0.004 Â± 0.001 mmÂ·cm-2Â·d-1 over winter, to 0.051 Â± 0.015 mmÂ·cm-2Â·d-1 during July, with peak growing season values comparable to those reported for many temperate forests using similar methods. On average, 84% of this production occurred within 20 cm of the moss surface, although the proportion occurring in deeper profiles increased as soils gradually warmed throughout the summer. Monthly rates of production and mortality were somewhat asynchronous because mortality tended to peak during fall and be minimal during periods of peak production. Production and mortality were, however, positively correlated across all tubes and time periods. Annual fine root production averaged 2.45 Â± 0.31, 8.01 Â± 1.39, and 2.53 Â± 0.27 mmÂ·cm-2Â·yr-1 (means Â± 1 se) among the three sites, when averaged across years. Fine root survival and decomposition were measured by tracking and analyzing the fate of individual fine roots using mark-recapture techniques. Fine root survival was greatest during periods of peak root growth, and least over winter (ftime). Roots first appearing in the middle of the growing season had higher survival rates than those first appearing early or late in the growing season, or over winter (fcohort), and risk of mortality decreased with root age (fage). Survival estimates translate to mean life spans of 108 Â± 4 d during the growing season. While these values are in striking contrast to needle longevity and rates of aboveground litter decomposition, they are similar to many values found for temperate systems, supporting the notion that there are basic morphological and physiological traits of first-order roots that are common to most woody plant root systems. During the growing season, monthly fine root decomposition rates averaged 0.46 Â± 0.01 per month, while decomposition rates over winter averaged 0.73 Â± 0.01 per winter. These growing season estimates translate to 49 Â± 2 d from the time a root was first observed as dead, to the time it disappeared. For roots that decomposed during the growing season, those with longer life spans decomposed more slowly after death. Comparing these results with other minirhizotron studies suggests that life-history traits of black spruce first-order roots are similar to those from temperate (and perhaps most) forest ecosystems. Annual production of fine roots averaged 228 Â± 75 g biomassÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, constituting ~56% of total stand production. Aboveground production of trees (50 Â± 14 g biomassÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, 13%) and shrubs (40 Â± 2 g biomassÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, 11%) contributed similarly to total production, while mosses (73 Â± 14 g biomassÂ·m-2Â·yr-1, 20%) accounted for the largest component of aboveground production. Soil temperature had a strong control over both soil respiration (Q10 = 2.21 Â± 0.31) and root respiration (Q10 = 2.30 Â± 0.37). During the growing season (15 May to 15 September), ~56% of soil CO2 efflux (580 Â± 40 g C/m2) was derived from fine root respiration (329 Â± 54 g C/m2). Although apparent rates of heterotrophic respiration (May through September) and total production did not differ, definitive estimates of net ecosystem production are impossible given the potentially large, unmeasured components of NPP (net primary production), such as root exudation and mycorrhizal production. Nevertheless, rates of fine root production, mortality, and decomposition indicate that in these black spruce ecosystems, fine roots are much more dynamic than would be predicted from patterns of aboveground processes, and that carbon, and presumably nutrients, are cycling through fine roots at rates several orders of magnitude faster than through aboveground tissues.

The forests measured along the transect intercepted from 22% to 99.5% of the incident PAR. With data collected from recording meteorological stations installed near each site, we defined the hourly conditions when photosynthesis was partly or completely limited by drought, extreme humidity deficits, or frost. From this analysis we calculated that the fraction of incident PAR that could be utilized throughout the year ranged from 92% in the coastal rainforests to <25% in the juniper woodland. NPP varied from 3 to 26 MgÂ°ha-1Â°yr-1 with the fraction of belowground NPP, estimated from litterfall, increasing from 20% to 60% of the total as the environment becomes harsher. Light-use efficiency (Â°u) calculated under conditions when the environment did not constrain photosynthesis, averaged 0.8 g/MJ for aboveground NPP and 1.3 g/MJ for total NPP. ",

This study presents a strategy for the processing, subsequent quality control and gap-filling of carbon dioxide eddy-covariance flux measurements for the derivation of annual sums of NEE. A set of criteria is used for quality assessment and to identify periods with instrumental or methodological failures. The complete evaluation scheme was applied to data recorded above a spruce forest at the FLUXNET-Station Waldstein-Weidenbrunnen (DE-Wei) in 2003. Comparison of this new evaluation scheme to the use of a friction velocity (u*) threshold criterion of 0.3 m s-1indicates less systematic distribution of data gaps. The number of available high quality night-time measurements increased. This effect was most pronounced during summer, when data is essential for a robust parameterisation of respiratory fluxes. Non-linear regression analysis showed that air temperature and global radiation explain most of the variability of NEE and further seasonal segregation of the data based on an objective method did not significantly improve predictions at this evergreen forest site.",

In one of the earliest replicated experimental sites for investigating growth of native tropical trees, we examined traits of tree species in relation to their effects on forest C balances, mechanisms of influence, and consequences for C sequestration. The monodominant stands, established in abandoned pasture in 1988 at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, contained five species in a complete randomized block design. Native species were: Hieronyma alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, and Vochysia guatemalensis. The exotic species was Pinus patula. By 16 years, the lack of differences among species in some attributes suggested strong abiotic control in this environment, where conditions are very favorable for growth. These attributes included aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), averaging 11.7 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 across species, and soil organic C (0-100 cm, 167 Mg C/ha). Other traits differed significantly, however, indicating some degree of biological control. In Vochysia plots, both aboveground biomass of 99 Mg C/ha, and belowground biomass of 20 Mg C/ha were 1.8 times that of Virola (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Differences among species in overstory biomass were not compensated by understory vegetation. Belowground NPP of 4.6 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1 in Hieronyma was 2.4 times that of Pinus (P < 0.01). Partitioning of NPP to belowground components in Hieronyma was more than double that of Pinus (P = 0.03). The canopy turnover rate in Hieronyma was 42% faster than that of Virola (P < 0.01). Carbon sequestration, highest in Vochysia (7.4 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, P = 0.02), averaged 5.2 Mg CÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, close to the annual per capita fossil fuel use in the United States of 5.3 Mg C. Our results indicated that differences in species effects on forest C balances were related primarily to differences in growth rates, partitioning of C among biomass components, tissue turnover rates, and tissue chemistry. Inclusion of those biological attributes may be critical for robust modeling of C cycling across the moist tropical forest biome. ",

For a unit of ground surface, the carbon flux involved in wood production and association constructed respiration was 210 g.m-2.yr-1 in a 4-yr-old stand, but declined to 46 g.m-2.yr-1 in a 245-yr-old stand. However, maintenance respiration of woody tissue in stems and branches consumed only 61 g.m-2.yr-1 in the 40-yr-old stand and 79 g.m-2.yr-1 in the 245-yr-old stand. The slight, nonsignificant increase in maintenance respiration of woody tissues could not explain the dramatic decline in aboveground wood production in the old-growth stand. ",

Mean foliage respiration at 10Â°C for expanded leaves was 0.21-0.95 Âµmol m-2 (leaf surface) s-1 for all species and differed little from May to September. Wood respiration at 15Â°C (0.2-1 Âµmol m-2 (stem surface) s-1 for all species) was strongly seasonal, with high rates in midsummer that coincided with wood growth. Fine root respiration at 10Â°C was 2.5-7.7 Âµmol kg-1 s-1 for all species and declined throughout the growing season for the conifers. Annual costs of Ra for foliage, wood, and roots (overstory and understory) were 490, 610, and 450 g C m-2 (ground) yr-1 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) in northern Manitoba and 600, 480, and 310 g C m-2 yr-1 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) in central Saskatchewan. Carbon use efficiency (CUE), the ratio of net production to production plus Ra, averaged 0.44, 0.34, and 0.39 for aspen, black spruce, and jack pine (old) for all tissues and 0.61, 0.36, and 0.44 for aboveground tissues. Differences in CUE between the northern and the southern sites were small for all species, and CUE did not vary with stand biomass. Species differences in CUE suggest that models assuming a constant CUE across species may poorly estimate production and carbon balance for any given site. ",

The problem is fundamental to forest biology, commercial forestry (the decline sets the rotation age), and to carbon storage in forests. We tested three hypotheses about mechanisms causing the decline in wood growth by quantifying the complete carbon budget of developing stands for over six years (a full rotation) in replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna near Pepeekeo, Hawaii. Our first hypothesis was that gross primary production (GPP) does not decline with stand age, and that the decline in wood growth results from a shift in partitioning from wood production to respiration (as tree biomass accumulates), total belowground carbon allocation (as a result of declining soil nutrient supply), or some combination of these or other sinks. An alternative hypothesis was that GPP declines with stand age and that the decline in aboveground wood production is proportional to the decline in GPP. A decline in GPP could be driven by reduced canopy leaf area and photosynthetic capacity resulting from increasing nutrient limitation, increased abrasion between tree canopies, lower turgor pressure to drive foliar expansion, or hydraulic limitation of water flux as tree height increases. A final hypothesis was a combination of the first two: GPP declines, but the decline in wood production is disproportionately larger because partitioning shifts as well. We measured the entire annual carbon budget (aboveground production and respiration, total belowground carbon allocation [TBCA], and GPP) from 0.5 years after seedling planting through 6Â½ years (when trees were ~25 m tall). The replicated plots included two densities of trees (1111 trees/ha and 10 000 trees/ha) to vary the ratio of canopy leaf mass to wood mass in the individual trees, and three fertilization regimes (minimal, intensive, and minimal followed by intensive after three years) to assess the role of nutrition in shaping the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production. The forest closed its canopy in 1-2 years, with peak aboveground wood production, coinciding with canopy closure, of 1.2-1.8 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1. Aboveground wood production declined from 1.4 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 2 to 0.60 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 6. Hypothesis 1 failed: GPP declined from 5.0 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 2 to 3.2 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 6. Aboveground woody respiration declined from 0.66 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 2 to 0.22 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 6 and TBCA declined from 1.9 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 2 to 1.4 kg CÂ·m-2Â·yr-1 at age 6. Our data supported hypothesis 3: the decline in aboveground wood production (42% of peak) was proportionally greater than the decline in canopy photosynthesis (64% of peak). The fraction of GPP partitioned to belowground allocation and foliar respiration increased with stand age and contributed to the decline in aboveground wood production. The decline in GPP was not caused by nutrient limitation, a decline in leaf area or in photosynthetic capacity, or (from a related study on the same site) by hydraulic limitation. Nutrition did interact with the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production, because treatments with high nutrient availability declined more slowly than did our control treatment, which was fertilized only during stand establishment.

An understanding of the mechanistic basis for patterns in wood production within a stand and across landscapes requires a complete annual carbon budget. We measured annual carbon flows to wood production, foliage production and total belowground carbon flux (the sum of root production, root respiration, and mycorrhizal production and respiration) from ages three to five years in clonal Eucalyptus plantations at four sites in Brazil to test if fertility, water availability and stand structure changed wood production and by what mechanism. We also quantified the patterns in light interception and the efficiency of light use to provide additional mechanistic insights into growth responses and to determine if light-use efficiency was related to changes in flux and partitioning.The routine level of forest fertilization at these four sites was high enough that further increases in nutrient supply did not increase wood growth. Irrigation increased wood net primary productivity (age three to five) from 1.45 to 1.84Â kgÂ m-2Â year-1 of C (27%), because of increases in light interception (5%), photosynthetic efficiency (from 0.028 to 0.031Â molÂ C/mol photons absorbed, 11%), gross primary productivity (from 3.62 to 4.28Â m-2Â year-1 of C, 18%), and partitioning to wood (from 0.397 to 0.430 of photosynthesis, 8%). These changes increased light-use efficiency by 20%. Annual flux belowground varied among sites from 0.43 to 1.0Â m-2Â year-1 of C but did not vary with water availability. Across the four sites for the irrigated and unirrigated treatments, light-use efficiency was positively correlated with gross primary productivity and partitioning to wood production. Increasing heterogeneity of stand structure (resulting from staggered timing of planting within plots) led to a 14% loss in wood biomass relative to uniform stand structure at age six. Light-use efficiency, gross primary productivity, and wood net primary productivity were lower, but not significantly so, in heterogeneous compared to uniform stands.",

Previous to a long-term measurement, a comparison of flux measurements using open- and closed-path type infrared gas analyzers was conducted for CO2 and water vapor. The closure of the energy budget over the forest was also examined to test the validity of the flux measurements.Using a whole year data from 25 July 1998 to 24 July 1999, the relation between the night-time air temperature and the night-time CO2 flux over the forest (ecosystem respiration) was investigated. The results suggest that the night-time CO2 flux was significantly influenced by the vertical air temperature gradient over the canopy. The night-time CO2 flux increased exponentially with the temperature when the stability was nearly neutral, while it was insensitive to the temperature under stable conditions.Daily values of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the gross primary production (GPP) of the forest were estimated, and they were parameterized as a function of the air temperature and the absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR). The results show a clear seasonal change in GPP caused by changes in the light-use efficiency and the maximum rate of carbon fixation of the canopy with LAI. The estimated NEE based on the parameterization agrees well with the observed NEE during the observational period.",

In the aerodynamic method, the CO2 flux is estimated using the vertical gradient of the CO2 concentration and the diffusion coefficient over the canopy. The eddy fluxes of sensible heat, water vapor, and CO2 are measured using a sonic anemometer and a closed-path infrared gas analyzer. The CO2 flux estimated by the eddy covariance method was mainly used to analyze observational errors and uncertainties caused by measurement and data processing. The CO2 flux determined by the aerodynamic method was validated by comparison with that estimated by the eddy covariance method.The nighttime net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was highly sensitive to atmospheric stability because of the complex terrain around the site. The nighttime NEE was estimated with and without correction, depending on the friction velocity. The annual net ecosystem production (NEP) values for 1999, 2000, and 2001 were estimated to be 198, 309, and 290Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 with correction and 251, 376, and 342Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 without correction, respectively. The nighttime correction is responsible for an uncertainty of approximately 50-70Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 in the annual NEP at this site.The NEP has been calculated for 9 years, which is the longest record at any particular site in Asia, as a consequence of the flux measurements. The annual NEP was estimated to be 237Â Â±Â 92Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 (meanÂ Â±Â S.D.) from 1994 to 2002 with a large year-to-year variability. The annual NEP had a similar year-to-year variation to that for gross primary production (GPP), and the carbon budget components representing productivity had more remarkable year-to-year variability than the respiration (ecosystem respiration and soil respiration). A high annual NEP was observed in 1998 (329Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1) and in 2002 (346Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), mainly due to the high CO2 uptake observed during the first half of the growth period in both years. The results of the present study suggest that the high GPP in 1998 and 2002 was caused by early leaf emergence related to an unusually warm spring under the influence of the El Nino. The results also suggest that the increase in CO2 uptake due to the long growth periods in 1998 and 2002 was more marked than the enhancement of respiration in the cool-temperate forest.",

For each stand age, three forest stands with similar characteristics of soil type and site preparation were used. There were no significant differences in total soil respiration among sites of the same age, except for the case of a 15-year-old stand that had lower soil respiration rates due to its higher productivity. Soil respiration initially decreased with stand age, but levelled out in the older stands. The youngest stands had significantly higher respiration rates than more mature sites. Annual soil respiration rates were modelled by means of temperature-derived functions. The average Q10 value obtained treating all the stands together was 3.8. Annual soil respiration rates were 991, 686, 556, and 564 g C m-2 for the 10-, 15-, 31-, and 47-year-old stands, respectively. We used the trenching approach to separate soil respiration components. Heterotrophic respiration paralleled soil organic carbon dynamics over the chronosequence, decreasing with stand age to slightly increase in the oldest stand as a result of accumulated aboveground litter and root inputs. Root respiration showed a decreasing trend with stand age, which was explained by a decrease in fine root biomass over the chronosequence, but not by nitrogen concentration of fine roots. The decrease in the relative contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil CO2 efflux from 59.3% in the youngest stand to 49.7% in the oldest stand was explained by the higher activity of the root system in younger stands. Our results show that stand age should be considered if simple temperature-based models to predict annual soil respiration in afforestation sites are to be used. ",

The study aimed at identifying easily determinable environmental parameters that explained the variation in soil respiration rates. The variation in temperature and soil water content influenced the seasonal trend observed in the spatial variability of soil respiration. The highest coefficients of variation in soil respiration were observed during autumn drought, while lower coefficients were generally observed during periods with highest soil respiration rates. On average, the sampling strategy of 30 sampling points per stand was adequate to obtain an average rate of soil respiration within 20% of its actual value at the 95% confidence level. Significantly higher soil respiration rates were observed at locations with high accumulation of organic matter and in collars established in close vicinity to tree stems. The organic layer thickness was the only variable that yielded significant regressions for explaining spatial variation in soil respiration in all the stands. Correlation analyses between the studied variables and soil respiration suggested the relative importance of heterotrophic and autotrophic components differed in their annual contribution to total soil respiration at each forest stand. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relative importance of primary temporal and spatial controls over soil respiration. Soil temperature and organic layer thickness explained most of the variance of soil respiration for the different sampling periods, while soil water content had a weaker effect as well as a different influence on soil respiration depending on the time of the year. The strong linear correlation between forest floor carbon and soil carbon stock further confirmed organic layer thickness as an integrative factor encompassing the effect of soil carbon pools on soil respiration. Moreover, its inclusion in the multiple regression analyses overrode the influence of both distance and fine root biomass. Overall, a multiple linear regression model driven by easily determinable environmental variables such as soil temperature, organic thickness, soil water content, soil bulk density, and soil organic carbon concentration allowed us to explain 54% of total variance of soil respiration over the different stand ages for the entire year (PÂ <Â 0.05). Our results show that the adoption of an adequate sampling strategy, and the determination of some key environmental variables may help to explain a large proportion of total variation of soil respiration over the entire rotation length of afforested ecosystems.",

The process-based PATCIS model was applied to a first rotation young Sitka spruce stand in order to simulate the seasonal contribution of soil respiration components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. We evaluated the performance of the model with observed measurements and compared it with empirically derived regressions. Once the model was parameterised, it explained 75% of the seasonal variation in total soil CO2 efflux. Similar seasonal trends and annual estimates of soil CO2 efflux were obtained with either empirical or the process-based PATCIS models. Heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration contributed almost equally to total CO2 efflux during the early and late part of the year, while a larger contribution of autotrophic respiration to total CO2 efflux occurred during the growing season. The overall annual contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil CO2 efflux was 54.7%. Most of root respiration took place in both the litter-humus layer and the A1 horizon as a result of their large concentrations of fine roots. We observed an accumulation of organic matter in the litter-humus layer, and a net loss from the mineral soil, which had much larger organic matter content compared to the litter-humus layer. The organic matter turnover rate calculated for the mineral soil was 45Â years (mean residence time).The sensitivity analysis showed soil temperature as the most important factor controlling soil respiration. The influence of soil moisture was more variable and had an overall negative effect on soil respiratory rates, except for periods of low soil water content, such as summer drought. The episodic occurrence of very wet conditions at the deeper soil layers was responsible for their low contribution to total soil respiration. In general, gas transport within the soil was not an important constraint for soil CO2 efflux since most of soil respiration was produced in the highly porous litter-humus and top mineral layers. The autotrophic component was more affected than heterotrophic respiration by changes in soil water content. Other factors such as changes in litterfall inputs were shown to have a more limited impact on soil CO2 efflux. This work shows that the use of a process-based model to simulate soil CO2 efflux may be a useful tool to separate soil respiration components.",

We conducted a 1 year continuous measurement of soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes with automated chamber systems in three plots with different soil characteristics and water content to investigate how temporal variations in CH4 fluxes vary with the soil environment. CH4 absorption was reduced by the â€œBaiuâ€ summer rainfall event and peaked during the subsequent hot, dry period. Although CH4 absorption and CO2 emission typically increased as soil temperature increased, the temperature dependence of CH4 varied more than that of CO2, possibly due to the changing balance of activities between methanotrophs and methanogens occurring over a wide temperature range, which was strongly affected by soil water content. In short time intervals (30 min), the responses of CH4 and CO2 fluxes to rainfall were different for each plot. In a dry soil plot with a thick humus layer, both fluxes decreased abruptly at the peak of rainfall intensity. After rainfall, CO2 emission increased quickly, while CH4 absorption increased gradually. Release of accumulated CO2 underground and restriction and recovery of CH4 and CO2 exchange between soil and air determined flux responses to rainfall. In a wet soil plot and a dry soil plot with a thinner humus layer, abrupt decreases in CH4 fluxes were not observed. Consequently, the Asian monsoon rainfall strongly influenced temporal variations in CH4 fluxes, and the differences in flux responses to environmental factors among plots caused large variability in annual budgets of CH4 fluxes.

This means that the differences between dSOM and dRHI are large enough to calculate the contributions of RRHI, RSOM and RL to RS based on the mass balance of the CO2 isotope ratios. RRHI and RSOM had close relationships with soil temperature, and RL was influenced by soil temperature and moisture. In summer, under high soil temperatures, RRHI and RSOM were the predominant sources of RS and the proportion of RRHI to RSOM to RL was 51:44:5.

Fluxes of CO2 from soil to the atmosphere, on the other hand, have not been addressed comprehensively in regard to temporal and spatial variations and to land cover change, and have been measured directly only in a few locations in Amazonia. Considerable variation exists across the Amazon Basin in soil properties, climate, and management practices in forests and cattle pastures that might affect soil CO2 fluxes. Here we report soil CO2 fluxes from an area of rapid deforestation in the southwestern Amazonian state of Acre. Specifically we addressed (1) the seasonal variation of soil CO2 fluxes, soil moisture, and soil temperature; (2) the effects of land cover (pastures, mature, and secondary forests) on these fluxes; (3) annual estimates of soil respiration; and (4) the relative contributions of grass-derived and forest-derived C as indicated by d13CO2. Fluxes were greatest during the wet season and declined during the dry season in all land covers. Soil respiration was significantly correlated with soil water-filled pore space but not correlated with temperature. Annual fluxes were higher in pastures compared with mature and secondary forests, and some of the pastures also had higher soil C stocks. The d13C of CO2 respired in pasture soils showed that high respiration rates in pastures were derived almost entirely from grass root respiration and decomposition of grass residues. These results indicate that the pastures are very productive and that the larger flux of C cycling through pasture soils compared with forest soils is probably due to greater allocation of C belowground. Secondary forests had soil respiration rates similar to mature forests, and there was no correlation between soil respiration and either forest age or forest biomass. Hence, belowground allocation of C does not appear to be directly related to the stature of vegetation in this region. Variation in seasonal and annual rates of soil respiration of these forests and pastures is more indicative of flux of C through the soil rather than major net changes in ecosystem C stocks. ",

However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that SR is also influenced by current, or recent, photosynthate. Accordingly, seasonal changes in SR nominally attributed to temperature may, in part, be due to seasonality in photosynthesis. Within a mixed coniferous-deciduous temperate forest, we measured SR and used the process model SECRETS to test whether seasonal changes in photosynthesis influence seasonal differences in SR. Measurements were made in six adjacent plots (from pure evergreen to pure deciduous) that exhibited a gradient in the seasonality of photosynthesis. Within all six plots, we found strong correlations between the basal rate of SR (BR; defined as the SR at 10Â°C) and modeled photosynthesis (i.e. gross primary productivity; GPP). Moreover, we observed larger seasonal changes in BR in those plots that exhibited larger seasonal changes in photosynthesis, as compared with plots with smaller changes in photosynthesis. This is relevant because estimates of the Q10 of SR (Q10 is the relative change in a process rate per temperature change of 10Â°C) typically assume a constant BR. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that differences in the apparent Q10 of SR (apparent Q10=Q10 derived from field measurements of SR and temperature) among studies may, in large part, be related to seasonal differences in photosynthesis. We suggest that variation in stand structure and species composition and, thus, in the photosynthetic signatures, induce different seasonal changes in BR via differences in the belowground supply of labile carbon. If these seasonal changes in BR are not properly accounted for, fitted apparent Q10 values may not express the temperature response of respiratory processes in the soil. ",

Monthly measurements of leaf, stem, and reproductive (flower plus fruit) litter and the forest floor litter mass were combined with a mass balance model to determine rates of litter decomposition for a semideciduous tropical forest located in the rain forest-savanna ecotone of the southern Amazon Basin for 2001-2007. Annual rates of litter production varied between 8 and 10.5 Mg ha-1 a-1, and leaf litter production accounted for the majority (~70%) of the total litter production. Leaf litter production peaked at the end of the May-August dry season while stem litter production peaked during the wet season and reproductive litter production peaked during the dry-wet season transition. Forest floor litter mass ranged between 5 and 8 Mg ha-1 over the study period and generally declined as litter inputs declined. Litter decomposition rates were remarkably stable from year-to-year and varied between 10.8 and 12.4 Mg ha-1 a-1. On average, rates of litter decomposition were highest during the dry-wet season transition. Overall, our results suggest that rainfall variability directly altered litter production dynamics and indirectly altered forest floor litter mass and decomposition kinetics through its effect on litter production. Future changes in seasonal and/or interannual rainfall patterns, whether in response to El Nino or to anthropogenic climate change, will likely have important consequences for the litter dynamics of Amazonian semideciduous forest.

Forest stands were classified into gap, pioneer, non-pioneer and mixed (pioneer, non-pioneer and unclassified trees) based on the species composition of trees >10Â cm diameter breast height. Soil respiration rates did not differ significantly between non-gap sites (1290Â Â±Â 210Â mgÂ CO2Â m-2Â h-1) but were double those in gap sites (640Â Â±Â 130Â mgÂ CO2Â m-2Â h-1). Post hoc analyses found that an increase in soil temperature and a decrease in litterfall and fine root biomass explained 72% of the difference between gap and non-gap sites. The significant decrease of soil respiration rates in gaps, irrespective of day or night time, suggests that autotrophic respiration may be an important contributor to total soil respiration in logged forests. We conclude that biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange models in tropical systems should incorporate gap frequency and that future research in tropical forest should emphasize the contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration.",

Campo sujo is a xeromorphic, open shrub savanna with very scattered but definitely visible shrubs and tree-like shrub elements. We studied two areas, one exposed to a prescribed fire late in the dry season, and a second that had not been burned for the previous 4Â years. 2 The fire on 22 September 1998 consumed an estimated 26Â molÂ CÂ m-2. Immediately after the fire, evapotranspiration rates decreased and the savanna became a stronger net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. This was attributed to the removal of the still slightly physiologically active grass layer and higher soil CO2 efflux rates as a consequence of elevated surface soil temperatures post-burning. 3 On the commencement of the first rains in early October 1998, this situation was reversed, with the burned area rapidly becoming a stronger sink for CO2 and with higher evapotranspiration rates than a nearby unburned (control) area. This difference persisted throughout the wet season (until at least June 1999) and was attributable to greater physiological activity of the regrowing vegetation in the burned area. Early in the growing season, higher soil evaporation rates may also have contributed to faster water use by the previously burned area. 4 Overall, we estimate an annual gross primary productivity for the burned area of 135Â molÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1, with that for the unburned area being 106Â molÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1. Estimated ecosystem respiration rates were more similar on an annual basis (96 and 82Â molÂ CÂ m-2 year-1 for the burned and unburned areas, respectively), giving rise to a substantially higher net ecosystem productivity for the previously burned area (38 vs 24Â molÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1). 5 Stimulation of photosynthetic activity in the rapid post-fire growth phase means that the negative effects of fire on the ecosystem carbon balance were more or less neutralized after only 12Â months.

As part of a long-term study on the chemical and biological effects of aboveground litterfall denial, root trenching and tree-stem girdling, we measured soil respiration for three years in plots where those treatments were applied singly and in combination. Tree-stem girdling terminates the flow of carbohydrates from canopy, but allows the roots to continue water and nutrient uptake. After carbon storage below the stem girdles is depleted, the girdled trees die. Root trenching immediately terminates root exudates as well as water and nutrient uptake. Excluding aboveground litterfall removes soil carbon inputs, but allows normal root functions to continue. We found that removing aboveground litterfall and the humus layer reduced soil respiration by more than the C input from litter, a respiration priming effect. When this treatment was combined with stem girdling, root trenching or those treatments in combination, the change in soil respiration was indistinguishable from the loss of litterfall C inputs. This suggests that litterfall priming occurs only when normal root processes persist. Soil respiration was significantly related to temperature in all treatment combinations, and to soil water content in all treatments except stem girdling alone, and girdling plus trenching. Aboveground litterfall was a significant predictor of soil respiration in control, stem-girdled, trenched and stem-girdled plus trenching treatments. Stem girdling significantly reduced soil respiration as a single factor, but root trenching did not. These results suggest that in addition to temperature, aboveground carbon inputs exert strong controls on forest soil respiration.",

In this study, we present data on winter soil respiration measured as CO2 efflux through the snow cover and the fraction of root respiration through trenching. We compared three methods: (1) a closed dynamic chamber on the snow surface (FChamb), (2) diffusional flux calculation based on the conductance properties of the snow pack and the CO2 concentration gradient between the soil surface and the snow surface (F2Point), (3) diffusional flux calculated on the basis of incrementally measured CO2 concentration profiles through the snow pack (FProbe). Lateral diffusion and retention of CO2 within the snow pack accounted for an average 38% flux underestimation by FChamb. F2Point and FProbe yielded similar C flux estimates, except where ice layers within the snow profile partially blocked CO2 diffusion and led to a non-linear CO2 gradient and an overestimation of the C flux by the F2Point method. The insulating effect of the snow cover kept soil temperatures above freezing, even where air temperatures were far below 0Â Â°C. CO2 efflux was highest in early winter (0.64Â Â±Â 0.05Â ÂµmolÂ CO2-CÂ m-2Â s-1) and decreased until the end of snow cover.

RS consists of an autotrophic (RA) and a heterotrophic (RH) component. We combined a soil warming experiment with a trenching experiment to assess how RS, RA, and RH are affected. The experiment was conducted in a mature forest dominated by Norway spruce. The site is located in the Austrian Alps on dolomitic bedrock. We warmed the soil of undisturbed and trenched plots by means of heating cables 4 Â°C above ambient during the snow-free seasons of 2005 and 2006. Soil warming increased the CO2 efflux from control plots (RS) by ~45% during 2005 and ~47% during 2006. The CO2 efflux from trenched plots (RH) increased by ~39% during 2005 and ~45% during 2006. Similar responses of RS and RH indicated that the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of RS responded equally to the temperature increase. Thirty-five to forty percent or 1 t C ha-1 yr-1 of the overall annual increase in RS (2.8 t C ha-1 yr-1) was autotrophic. The remaining, heterotrophic part of soil respiration (1.8 t C ha-1 yr-1), represented the warming-induced C loss from the soil. The autotrophic component showed a distinct seasonal pattern. Contribution of RA to RS was highest during summer. Seasonally derived Q10 values reflected this pattern and were correspondingly high (5.3-9.3). The autotrophic CO2 efflux increase due to the 4 Â°C warming implied a Q10 of 2.9. Hence, seasonally derived Q10 of RA did not solely reflect the seasonal soil temperature development. ",

The investigation of the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (F NEE) of the Scots pine forest started in the extraordinary hot and dry August 2003. Carbon dioxide fluxes were measured continuously using an eddy covariance system and analysed by use of the EDDYSOFT software package. After determining the temperature dependence of the forest ecosystem respiration and the daytime light dependence of the CO2 exchange, monthly and annual carbon balances of the Scots pine forest were calculated. Mean peak daytime F NEE rates observed in August and September 2003 (-6.5Â±3.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1) were drastically lower than in August and September 2004 (-11.8Â±5.2Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1), which did not show pronounced deviations from the mean long-term (1978-2002) climatic conditions. In August 2003, the Hartheim Scots pine forest was a distinct CO2 source (35Â gÂ CÂ m-2). The estimates of the annual carbon sink strength of the Scots pine forest ranged between -132Â gÂ CÂ m-2 (August 2003-July 2004) and -211Â gÂ CÂ m-2 (October 2003-September 2004). The main uncertainty in the determination of the carbon balance of the Hartheim Scots pine forest was introduced by the frequently low turbulence levels, i.e. the friction velocity corrected night-time F NEE fluxes.",

There are few studies that have estimated CWD biomass in temperate forests of the southern hemisphere. In Chile, this is the first study of CWD in Andean old-growth forests, where tree-fall is the most common type of disturbance and generates a mosaic of different structures within a forest stand, both conditions that must affect the quantity and quality of CWD. We estimated and analyzed CWD biomass in two differing old-growth forest stands, one composed mainly by Nothofagus dombeyi, Laureliopsis philippiana and Saxegothaea conspicua (Nothofagus-dominated stand) and another composed mainly by L. philippiana, S. conspicua and Dasyphyllum diancanthoides (Mixed-species stand). We set up 80 and 95 circular 0.05-ha plots in these stands, where we measured all live trees =5Â cm diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.3Â m), recorded diameters at the large and small ends of logs and snags, and total length of logs or total height of snags, and classified these within three decay classes. The Nothofagus-dominated forest stand had 88.8Â MgÂ ha-1 of CWD biomass, compared to 59.6Â MgÂ ha-1 in the Mixed-species stand, a difference that can be attributed basically to the greater biomass of snags in the former, where most biomass of CWD, logs and snags belonged to N. dombeyi. In both stands we found that most plots had a tree structure dominated by small trees; these plots had greater CWD biomass, of which most was in decay class III, likely reflecting past tree falls that reduced the numbers of large trees and increased CWD. At the stand level the only significant but low correlation occurred between log biomass in decay class III and mean diameter of the plots. However, there were strong relationships of mean diameter (QMD) of the different structural types and log biomass in decay class III in both stands, thus reflecting that diameter structure (or QMD) can be a good predictor of log biomass. CWD biomass in these Valdivian old-growth rainforests is in the range of values found for North Patagonian rainforests sampled with similar plot size, greater than biomass in deciduous forests in North America, and lower than temperate rainforests in the Pacific Northwest in North America, in New Zealand and Tasmania. Differences can be attributed to forest type, forest productivity, and successional phase.",

Turbulent flux measurements are obtained by an eddy-covariance system at 46Â m (1.8 times the canopy height) with a closed-path infrared gas analyzer.Peak vegetation area index (VAI) was determined as 4.7Â±0.5 and the mean albedo during the vegetative period was 0.15Â±0.02. The aerodynamic roughness length was estimated as 2.1Â±1.1Â m. It showed little variation with wind direction or season. The seasonal variations of energy partitioning and of net CO2 exchange are discussed in terms of the phenological development of the forest. To estimate the annual net ecosystem production (NEP) and carbon sequestration, eddy-covariance measurements during periods of poorly developed turbulence at night, and missing data were replaced by a simple parametric model based on measurements of soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The night-time flux correction reduces the annual sequestration estimate by almost 50%. The corrected estimate of annual NEP for the 1998-1999 season is 2.4Â t C ha-1 per year Â±10%.",

The primary measurement methodology uses eddy covariance systems with closed-path infrared gas analyzers at two heights (46 and 34 m) above the forest (canopy height is ~22 m). One objective is to contribute to a more firmly established methodology of estimating annual net ecosystem production (NEP), by systematically examining the consequences of several variations of criteria to identify periods of unreliable measurements, and to fill gaps in the data. We compared two methods to fill data gaps (about 30% of time in 1999) due to missing observations or rejected data after quality control; one using short-term ensemble averages of the daily course and the other by semiempirical parametric models based on relationships between ecosystem respiration and soil temperature and between gross ecosystem photosynthetic uptake and photosynthetically active radiation. The modeled estimates were also used to replace eddy covariance fluxes during periods of weak and/or poorly developed turbulence when eddy covariance measurements cannot be expected to represent the ecosystem exchange. Examination of the fractions of eddy covariance fluxes and storage change relative to the expected ecosystem respiration suggested a friction velocity (u*) of 0.35 m s-1 as the lower limit for the acceptance of micrometeorologically determined NEE for this site. The differences in estimated annual NEP due to different criteria of data acceptance, measurement height, or gap-filling strategies turned out to be at least as large as the interannual variations over the 3 years. After discussing various analysis strategies we conclude that the best estimate of annual NEP at our site is achieved by replacing data gaps and measurements in low-u* conditions at all times with site and period-specific parametric models, using the upper measurement level (about 2.1 canopy heights). These â€œbest estimatesâ€ of annual NEP for 1999-2001 amounted to 170 (1999), 160 (2000), and 80 (2001) g C m-2. We also discuss some problems of assigning quantitative estimates of uncertainty for annual NEP. ",

These plains have a high erosion potential for salt crusts accumulated at the soil surface. Hence it may be hypothesized that East African montane forest ecosystems experience strongly enhanced nutrient inputs via dry deposition, which alters their overall biogeochemistry. The aim of our study was to test this hypothesis by investigating K, Mg, Ca, Na and N-forms in rainfall, throughfall, fine litter, litter percolate and soil solution of a montane rain forest at Mt. Kilimanjaro. Four forest plots situated at elevations between 2250 and 2350 m asl on the south-western slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro were studied for 2 y. In contradiction to our hypothesis, inputs of K, Mg, Ca and Na via rainfall (7.5, 0.9, 2.3 and 6.2kg ha-1y-1) and throughfall (35, 2.0, 3.5 and 11kg ha-1-1) were low on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Fluxes of NH4-N and NO3-N were within the range observed at other montane rain forests, with NO3-N being the only nutrient partly absorbed in the forest canopies (2.9kg ha-1y-1 in rainfall, 0.9kg ha-1y-1 in throughfall). The highest overall nutrient concentrations in water samples occurred in litter percolate (1.4mg l-1 K, 0.3mg l-1 Mg, 0.8mg l-1 Ca, 0.3mg l-1 NH4-N, 0.9mg l-1 NO3-N), with values still being low compared to other sites. Nutrient concentrations in seepage water strongly declined with increasing soil depth. Thus, both inputs and losses of base cations from the forest by water pathways are assumed to be low. N or P limitation of growth is not expected since high fluxes of N and P in fine litter (119 and 5.9kg ha-1y-1 for N and P respectively) indicate low within-stand efficiency.",

The mature stand with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is located in the north-eastern German lowlands (Brandenburg). Soil carbon fluxes of the trenched and non-trenched plots were measured once a week with a closed chamber method to separate heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration. Annual wood increments were continuously measured by dendrometer bands. A strong correlation was found between observed and predicted soil respiration fluxes calculated on the basis of the measured soil temperatures and soil water contents. Carbon sequestration by accumulation in the aboveground biomass accounted for 1.67Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1. Including the C-sequestration in coarse roots the net primary production (NPP) increased to 2.0Â Mg C per ha and year. Carbon release from soil by apparent heterotrophic respiration was overestimated due to higher soil moisture in the rootless trenching plots. Therefore we adjusted the apparent heterotrophic respiration by means of predicted water contents of the trenched plots, using a SVAT model. Accordingly the apparent heterotrophic respiration rate was 0.94Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1 resulting in a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 1.06Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1. The net C loss from the soil carbon pool may be caused by higher temperatures, which were increased by 1.5Â Â°C during the observation period compared to the long-term temperature average (1961-1990). These short-term changes have to be regarded carefully interpreting measured carbon sequestration rates of forest ecosystems in the global carbon cycle.",

Rupr. in eastern Siberia. Constituting six forest types based on understorey plants, the stands were representative of vegetation throughout the Yakutsk region. Average tree height, diameter, and density ranged from 2 m, 23 mm, and 50 800 stems/ha in the 50-year-old stand to 11 m, 160 mm, and 600 stems/ha in the oldest stand. Aboveground biomass in the 50-year-old stand was 4.4 kgâ€¢m-2, and the aboveground N pool was 1.1 molâ€¢m-2. This was slightly higher than the N pool in a 125-year-old stand with a Ledum understorey (1.0 molâ€¢m-2), despite its higher biomass (7.2 kgâ€¢m-2). The highest observed aboveground biomass in a 125-year-old stand (characterized by the N2-fixing understorey plant Alnasterfruticosa) reached 12.0 kgâ€¢m-2, but the corresponding N pool was only 1.6 molâ€¢m-2. In the oldest stand, aboveground biomass was 8.9 kgâ€¢m-2 and the N pool was 1.1 molâ€¢m-2. There was thus a relatively constant quantity of N in the aboveground biomass of stands differing in age by almost 400 years. We postulate that N sets a limit on carbon accumulation in this boreal forest type. Trees were extremely slow growing, and there was essentially no aboveground biomass accumulation between the ages of 130 and 380 years because of a lack of available N. This conclusion was supported by graphical analysis indicating that the self-thinning process in our stands was not governed by the availability of radiation according to allometric theory. Much of the available N was used in the production of tree stems where 86% of the aboveground N (and 96% of aboveground biomass) was immobilized in the oldest stand. N in wood of the old stand exceeded the N pool in the litter layer and was 20% of the N pool in the Ah horizon. The processes of carbon and N partitioning were further explored by the estimation of carbon and N fluxes during three periods of forest development. We calculated a loss of ecosystem N during the period of self-thinning, while in the mature stands the N cycle appeared to be very tight. The immobilized N is returned from the wood into a plant-available form only by a recurrent fire cycle, which regenerates the N cycle. Thus fire is an essential component for the persistence of the L. gmelinii forest.",

We examine the productivity of ecosystems, expressed as positive rate when the amount of carbon in the ecosystem increases, while (following micrometeorological convention) downward fluxes from the atmosphere to the vegetation (NEE = Net Ecosystem Exchange) are expressed as negative numbers. Productivity parameters are Net Primary Productivity (NPP=whole plant growth), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP = CO2 assimilation minus ecosystem respiration), and Net Biome Productivity (NBP = NEP minus carbon losses through disturbances bypassing respiration, e.g. by fire and logging). Based on chronosequence studies and national forestry statistics we estimate a low average NPP for boreal forests in Siberia: 123 gC m-2 y-1. This contrasts with a similar calculation for Europe which suggests a much higher average NPP of 460 gC m-2 y-1 for the forests there. Despite a smaller area, European forests have a higher total NPP than Siberia (1.2-1.6 vs. 0.6-0.9 x 1015 gC region-1 y-1). This arises as a consequence of differences in growing season length, climate and nutrition.  For a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands studied in central Siberia during summer, NEE was most negative in a 67-y old stand regenerating after fire (- 192 mmol m-2 d-1) which is close to NEE in a cultivated forest of Germany (- 210 mmol m-2 d-1). Considerable net ecosystem CO2-uptake was also measured in Siberia in 200- and 215-y old stands (NEE:174 and - 63 mmol m-2 d-1) while NEP of 7- and 13-y old logging areas were close to the ecosystem compensation point. Two Siberian bogs and a bog in European Russia were also significant carbon sinks (- 102 to - 104 mmol m-2 d-1). Integrated over a growing season (June to September) we measured a total growing season NEE of - 14 mol m-2 summer-1 (- 168 gC m-2 summer-1) in a 200-y Siberian pine stand and - 5 mol m-2 summer-1 (- 60 gC m-2 summer-1) in Siberian and European Russian bogs. By contrast, over the same period, a spruce forest in European Russia was a carbon source to the atmosphere of (NEE: + 7 mol m-2 summer-1 = + 84 gC m-2 summer-1). Two years after a windthrow in European Russia, with all trees being uplifted and few successional species, lost 16 mol C m-2 to the atmosphere over a 3-month in summer, compared to the cumulative NEE over a growing season in a German forest of - 15.5 mol m-2 summer-1 (- 186 gC m-2 summer-1; European flux network annual averaged - 205 gC m-2 y-1).  Differences in CO2-exchange rates coincided with differences in the Bowen ratio, with logging areas partitioning most incoming radiation into sensible heat whereas bogs partitioned most into evaporation (latent heat). Effects of these different surface energy exchanges on local climate (convective storms and fires) and comparisons with the Canadian BOREAS experiment are discussed.  Following a classification of disturbances and their effects on ecosystem carbon balances, fire and logging are discussed as the main processes causing carbon losses that bypass heterotrophic respiration in Siberia. Following two approaches, NBP was estimated to be only about 13-16 mmol m-2 y-1 for Siberia. It may reach 67 mmol m-2 y-1 in North America, and about 140-400 mmol m-2 y-1 in Scandinavia.  We conclude that fire speeds up the carbon cycle, but that it results also in long-term carbon sequestration by charcoal formation. For at least 14 years after logging, regrowth forests remain net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. This has important implications regarding the effects of Siberian forest management on atmospheric concentrations. For many years after logging has taken place, regrowth forests remain weaker sinks for atmospheric CO2 than are nearby old-growth forests. ",

Differences in precipitation can affect soil carbon storage either by altering the biotic processes involved in carbon cycling or by altering abiotic processes such as carbon adsorption on soil minerals. We compared the relative effect of water on net primary productivity and decomposition, and on soil weathering and mineralogy in controlling soil carbon storage in forests. Patterns of ecosystem carbon cycling and soil carbon storage were measured in Hawaiian montane forest sites similar in temperature regime, parent material, ecosystem age, vegetation, and topographical relief, while mean annual precipitation alone varied from 2200 to >5000 mm/yr. Soil carbon storage ranged from 30.9 to 62.5 kg/m2 and increased by a factor of 1.7 with increased precipitation across the gradient. Neither changes in total secondary minerals nor noncrystalline mineral content could explain increased soil carbon as both decreased with increasing precipitation. Aboveground net primary productivity, soil carbon dioxide flux, and plant litter decomposition rates also decreased with increased precipitation. These data suggest that increased soil carbon storage was not stimulated by an increase in net primary productivity, but instead by a decrease in decomposition rates. Decreased decomposition rates corresponded with low soil reduction-oxidation potentials, suggesting that soil oxygen availability was limiting to microbes. While soil oxygen did not appear to affect plant growth directly, the decline in net primary productivity corresponded with decreased nitrogen availability, a consequence of slower decomposition and nutrient release. Thus, in humid environments the most important effect of variation in water on carbon cycling appears to be its control on the diffusion of oxygen into the soil. ",

We develop additional postprocessing steps that estimate net primary productivity (PN), autotrophic (Ra), and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). This is based on conservation of mass of carbon (C), Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and three ratios: C use efficiency (CUE, PN to PG), Ra to RE, and FNEP to RE. This procedure, along with the estimation of FNEP, RE, and PG, was applied to a Douglas-fir dominated chronosequence on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The EC data set consists of 17 site years from three sites: initiation (HDF00), pole/sapling (HDF88), and near mature (DF49), with stand ages from 1 to 56 years. Analysis focuses on annual C flux totals and C balance ratios as a function of stand age, assuming a rotation age of 56 years. All six C balance terms generally increased with stand age. Average annual PN by stand was 213, 750, and 1261 g C m-2 yr-1 for HDF00, HDF88, and DF49, respectively. The canopy compensation point, the year when the chronosequence switched from a source to a sink of C, occurred at stand age ca. 20 years. HDF00 and HDF88 were strong and moderate sources (FNEP=-581 and -138 g C m-2 yr-1), respectively, while DF49 was a moderate sink (FNEP=294 g C m-2 yr-1) for C. Differences between sites were greater than interannual variation (IAV) within sites and highlighted the importance of age-related effects in C cycling. The validity of the approach is discussed using a sensitivity analysis, a comparison with growth and yield estimates from the same chronosequence, and an intercomparison with other chronosequences.

Many tropical forests grow on deeply weathered soils and although it is generally accepted that soil carbon decomposition increases with higher temperatures, it is not known whether subsurface carbon pools are particularly responsive to increasing soil temperatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusing out of soils is an important flux in the global carbon. Although soil CO2 efflux has been the subject of many studies in recent years, it remains difficult to deduct controls of this flux because of the different sources that produce CO2 and because potential environmental controls like soil temperature and soil moisture often covary. Here, we report results of a 5-year study in which we measured soil CO2 production on two deeply weathered soil types at different depths in an old-growth tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Three sites were developed on old river terraces (old alluvium) and the other three were developed on old lava flows (residual). Annual soil CO2 efflux varied between 2.8-3.6 Âµmol CO2-C m-2 s-1 (old alluvium) and 3.4-3.9 Âµmol CO2-C m-2 s-1 (residual). More than 75% of the CO2 was produced in the upper 0.5 m (including litter layer) and less than 7% originated from the soil below 1 m depth. This low contribution was explained by the lack of water stress in this tropical wet forest which has resulted in very low root biomass below 2 m depth. In the top 0.5 m CO2 production was positively correlated with both temperature and soil moisture; between 0.6 and 2 m depth CO2 production correlated negatively with soil moisture in one soil and positively with photosynthetically active radiation in the other soil type. Below 2 m soil CO2 production strongly increased with increasing temperature. In combination with reduced tree growth that has been shown for this ecosystem, this would be a strong positive feedback to ecosystem warming. ",

In this paper, we compare ecosystem water and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes over a grassland, a grassland-shrubland mosaic, and a fully developed woodland to evaluate potential consequences of woody-plant encroachment on important ecosystem processes. All three sites were located in the riparian corridor of a river in the southwest US. As such, plants in these ecosystems may have access to moisture at the capillary fringe of the near-surface water table. Using fluxes measured by eddy covariance in 2003 we found that ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) increased with increasing woody-plant dominance. Growing season ET totals were 407, 450, and 639 mm in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively, and in excess of precipitation by 227, 265, and 473 mm. This excess was derived from groundwater, especially during the extremely dry premonsoon period when this was the only source of moisture available to plants. Access to groundwater by the deep-rooted woody plants apparently decouples ecosystem ET from gross ecosystem production (GEP) with respect to precipitation. Compared with grasses, the woody plants were better able to use the stable groundwater source and had an increased net CO2 gain during the dry periods. This enhanced plant activity resulted in substantial accumulation of leaf litter on the soil surface that, during rainy periods, may lead to high microbial respiration rates that offset these photosynthetic fluxes. March-December (primary growing season) totals of NEE were -63, -212, and -233 g C m-2 in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively. Thus, there was a greater disparity between ecosystem water use and the strength of the CO2 sink as woody plants increased across the encroachment gradient. Despite a higher density of woody plants and a greater plant productivity in the woodland than in the shrubland, the woodland produced a larger respiration response to rainfall that largely offset its higher photosynthetic potential. These data suggest that the capacity for woody plants to exploit water resources in riparian areas results in enhanced carbon sequestration at the expense of increased groundwater use under current climate conditions, but the potential does not scale specifically as a function of woody-plant abundance. These results highlight the important roles of water sources and ecosystem structure on the control of water and carbon balances in dryland areas. ",

We used energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from eddy covariance along with standard meteorological and soil moisture measurements at a semiarid savanna in southern Arizona, United States, to better understand the consequences of warm or cool season drought on ecosystem CO2 exchange in these bimodally forced water-limited regions. Over the last 100 years, this historic grassland has converted to a savanna by the encroachment of the native mesquite tree (Prosopis velutina Woot.). During each of the 4 years of observation (2004-2007), annual precipitation (P) was below average, but monsoon (July-September) P was both above and below average while cool-season (December-March) P was always less than average by varying degrees. The ecosystem was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, ranging from 14 to 95 g C m-2 yr-1 with the strength of the source increasing with decreasing precipitation. When the rainfall was closest to the long-term average in its distribution and amount, the ecosystem was essentially carbon neutral. Summer drought resulted in increased carbon losses due mainly to a shortening of the growing season and the length of time later in the season when photosynthetic gain exceeds respiration loss. Severe cool season drought led to decreased spring carbon uptake and seemingly enhanced summer respiration, resulting in conditions that led to the greatest annual net carbon loss. ",

In order to minimize disturbance to the soil and maximize preservation of the natural relationships among roots, rhizospheric microorganisms, and decomposers, we conducted a girdling experiment in a subalpine forest dominated by lodgepole pine trees. In two separate years, we girdled trees in small forest plots (5-7 m in diameter) and trenched around the plots to sever invading roots in order to experimentally stop the transport of photosynthate from needles to roots, and eliminate rhizospheric respiration. Soil respiration rates in plots with trees girdled over 1 year prior to measurement were higher than those in plots with trees girdled 2-3 months prior to measurement. These results suggest that any stimulation of respiration because of the experimental artifact of fine root death and addition of labile carbon to the pool of decomposer substrates is slow, and occurs beyond the first growing season after girdling. Compared with control plots with nongirdled trees, soil respiration rates in plots with girdled trees were reduced by 31-44% at the mid-summer respiratory maximum. An extreme drought during one of the 2 years used for observations caused greater reductions in the heterotrophic component of soil respiration compared with the rhizospheric component. In control plots, we observed a pulse in K2SO4-extractable carbon during the spring snowmelt period, which was absent in plots with girdled trees. In control plots, soil microbial biomass increased from spring to summer, coincident with a seasonal increase in the rhizospheric component of soil respiration. In plots with girdled trees, the seasonal increase in microbial biomass was lower than in control plots. These results suggest that the observed seasonal increase in rhizospheric respiration rate in control plots was because of an increase in rhizospheric microbial biomass following â€˜soil priming' by a spring-time pulse in dissolved organic carbon. Winter-time, beneath-snow microbial biomass was relatively high in control plots. Soil sucrose concentrations were approximately eight times higher during winter than during spring or summer, possibly being derived from the mechanical damage of shallow roots that use sucrose as protection against low-temperature extremes. The winter-time sucrose pulse was not observed in plots with girdled trees. The results of this study demonstrate that (1) the rhizospheric component of soil respiration rate at this site is significant in magnitude, (2) the heterotrophic component of soil respiration rate is more susceptible to seasonal drought than the rhizospheric component, and (3) the trees in this ecosystem exert a major control over soil carbon dynamics by â€˜priming' the soil with sugar exudates during the late-spring snowmelt period and releasing high concentrations of sucrose to the soil during winter.

In the south-western United States, ponderosa pine forest structure was altered by disruption of the fire regime following Euro-American settlement. Forest structure is now being restored to presettlement conditions through the application of thinning and burning treatments. However, the effects of these treatments on below-ground ecosystem processes remain unclear. 2 We conducted a water and nitrogen (N) addition experiment in adjacent restored and unrestored ponderosa pine stands and compared soil CO2 efflux in response to these treatments over a 13-month period. Our goals were to (i) quantify water and N limitation to below-ground carbon (C) cycling in contemporary high-density ponderosa pine forests; and (ii) determine if restoration alleviates water and N limitations. 3 Restoration thinning and burning increased soil CO2 efflux, along with surface soil water content, temperature and herbaceous fine root biomass, while total fine root biomass decreased as a result of restoration. 4 Water and N additions increased C flux from soils to a similar degree in both restored and unrestored ponderosa pine stands, but the increase was relatively small when compared to that stimulated by restoration. 5 Synthesis and applications. An understanding of how ecosystem processes respond to treatments designed to restore ecosystem structure is critical in ensuring the long-term success of restoration efforts. Here we show that, although water and N stimulate C flux from soils in these semi-arid forests, restoration treatments have a much greater effect on soil C balance than increased water and N availability by themselves. This suggests that increased quality of C inputs from a recovering understorey herbaceous community is a key component of restoring ecosystem function (e.g. below-ground C cycling) in south-western ponderosa pine forests.

Mean litterfall production was 11.8 Mg ha-1 y-1 (5.7 Mg C ha-1 y-1). Litterfall showed strong seasonality, with the highest deposition in the driest months of the year. About two times more C per month was deposited on the forest floor during the 6-mo dry season (0.65 Mg C ha-1 mo-1) compared with the rainy season (0.3 Mg C ha-1 mo-1). The measured C concentration of the litterfall samples was significantly greater in the dry season than in the rainy season (49% vs. 46%). The lateral movement of litter increased from the plateau (upper landscape position) towards the riparian zone. However, the trend in C concentration of laterally transported litter samples was the opposite, being highest on the plateau (44%) and lowest in the riparian zone (42%). Stream-water exports of particulate C were positively correlated with streamflow, increasing in the rainiest months. The export of particulate C in streamflow was found to be very small (less than 1%) in relation to the amount of litterfall produced.",

We manipulated air temperature, soil temperature and soil moisture using passive, open-top chambers (OTCs) in three different ecosystem settings in close proximity (boreal forest, riparian area, and semi-arid steppe) to investigate how environmental factors would affect soil respiration in these different ecosystems, anticipating that soil respiration would increase in response to the chamber treatment. The results indicated that OTCs significantly increased air and soil temperature in areas with open canopy and short-statured vegetation (i.e., steppe areas) but not in forest. OTCs also affected soil moisture, but the direction of change depended on the ecosystem, and the magnitude of change was highly variable. Generally, OTCs did not affect soil respiration in steppe and riparian areas. Although soil respiration was slightly greater in OTCs placed in the forest, the difference was not statistically significant. Analyses of relationships between soil respiration and environmental variables suggested that different factors controlled soil respiration in the different ecosystems. Competing effects analysis using a model selection approach and regression analyses (e.g., Q10) demonstrated that soil respiration in the forest was more sensitive to warming, while soil respiration in the steppe was more sensitive to soil moisture. The differing responses and controlling factors among these neighboring forest, riparian and steppe ecosystems in Northern Mongolia highlight the importance of taking into account potential biome shifts in C cycling modeling to generate more accurate predictions of landscape-scale responses to anticipated climate change.",

We hypothesized that, with all other factors being equal, shorter winter SR result in reduced contribution to annual soil C flux. In this study, the contribution of winter soil respiration to annual soil respiration was measured for three sites (grassland: dominated by Artemisia sacrorum, Bothriochloa ischaemum and Themeda japonica; shrubland: dominated by Vitex negundo var. heterophylla; plantation: dominated by Populus tomatosa) in a mountainous area of north China. Diurnal and intra-annual soil CO2 flux patterns were consistent among different sites, with the maximum soil respiration rates at 12:00 or 14:00, and in July or August. The lowest respiration rates were seen in February. Mean soil respiration rates ranged from 0.26 to 0.45 Âµmol m-2 s-1 in the winter (December to February), and between 2.38 to 3.16 Âµmol m-2 s-1 during the growing season (May-September). The winter soil carbon flux was 24.6 to 42.8 g C m-2, which contributed 4.8 to 7.1% of the annual soil carbon flux. Based on exponential functions, soil temperature explained 73.8 to 91.8% of the within year variability in soil respiration rates. The Q10 values of SR against ST at 10 cm ranged from 3.60 to 4.90 among different sites. In addition, the equation between soil respiration and soil temperature for the growing season was used to calculate the â€œmodeledâ€ annual soil carbon flux based on the actual measured soil temperature. The â€œmeasuredâ€ annual value was significantly higher than the â€œmodeledâ€ annual value. Our results suggest that winter soil respiration plays a significant role in annual soil carbon balance, and should not be neglected when soil ecosystems are assessed as either sinks or sources of atmospheric CO2.

The land-use sequence contained natural forest (control treatment), secondary forest, two plantations, citrus orchard and sloping tillage land. Results showed that the RS exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern, and it was dominantly controlled by the soil temperature. After the land-use conversion, the apparent temperature sensitivity of RS (Q10) was increased from 2.10 in natural forest to 2.71 in sloping tillage land except for an abnormal decrease to 1.66 in citrus orchard. Contrarily, the annual RS was reduced by 32% following the conversion of natural forest to secondary forest, 46-48% to plantations, 63% to citrus orchard and 50% to sloping tillage land, with the average reduction of 48%. Such reduction of annual RS could be explained by the decrease of topsoil organic carbon and light-fraction organic carbon storages, live biomass of fine root (<2 mm) and annual litter input, which indirectly/directly correlated with plant productivity. Our results suggest that substrate availability (e.g., soil organic carbon and nutrients) and soil carbon input (e.g., fine root turnover and litterfall) through plant productivity may drive the RS both in natural and managed ecosystems following strong disturbance events.

Soil chambers were installed at the Kyoto, Miyazu-Oak, Miyazu-Cedar, Miyazu-Beech and Nobeyama sites; the sites differed from each other in soil temperature, vegetation and parent materials. The soil treatments applied at each of the 5 sites were as follows: (1) control plot, (2) O- plot with removal of the O layer, (3) root- plot with the suppression of root respiration by inserting the chambers to a depth of 20Â cm and sealing the bottom. The CO2 emission levels at all sites were significantly correlated with soil temperature, but not with soil moisture levels. The annual rates of soil organic matter decomposition simulated based on the automatically recorded soil temperature were 5.1, 4.0, 5.2, 5.5 and 3.4Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 at the Kyoto, Miyazu-Oak, Miyazu-Cedar, Miyazu-Beech and Nobeyama sites, respectively. These rates were influenced by soil temperature, litter fall rates and the carbon stocks. In contrast, the ratio of the annual rate of root respiration to the annual rate of soil respiration decreased as soil temperature decreased. Based on the carbon budget, the Miyazu-Cedar and Nobeyama sites appeared to have lost their soil carbon stock. For more accurate analysis, methods for the direct measurement of the input rate of root litter should be developed. ",

Depending on age and land use, they can act as carbon sources, sinks, or be in approximate balance, but it is uncertain if global environmental changes are forcing these ecosystems outside their natural range of variation. We asked the question of whether or not the net carbon flux of a tropical primary forest, which should be in balance over the long term, is within the expected range of natural variation. A simple Bayesian hypothesis testing method was used to address this question for primary forests in the Porce region of Colombia. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was measured in this forest in a set of 33 permanent plots from 2000 to 2002 in 2, 1-year intervals. Our estimate of NEP ranged between -4.03 and 2.22 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 for the two intervals. This range was compared with a priori defined range of natural variation estimated from the ecosystem model STANDCARB, which estimated spatial and temporal variation due to gap dynamics. The prior range of variation was estimated between -1.5 and 1.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. The observed data on NEP did not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that these forests are in C balance. We concluded that the ecosystem is likely behaving within its range of natural variation, but measurement uncertainties were a major limitation to finding evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A literature review of C flux studies in the tropics revealed that about half of the observations could be explained by gap dynamics alone, while significant C sinks have only been observed during La Nina years, with contrasting results in other tropical forests. In conclusion, observational data of carbon fluxes do not appear to provide direct evidence for a significant carbon sink in some sites in the tropics. ",

Carbon stocks in live aboveground and belowground biomass, necromass, and soils were measured in a heterogeneous landscape composed of secondary and primary forest. A total of 110 permanent plots were used to estimate the size of these carbon pools. Local biomass equations were developed and used to estimate aboveground biomass and coarse root biomass for each plot. Herbaceous vegetation, fine roots, coarse and fine litter, and soil carbon to 4Â m depth were measured in subplots. In primary forests, mean total carbon stocks (TCS) were estimated as 383.7Â Â±Â 55.5Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 (Â±S.E.). Of this amount, soil organic carbon to 4Â m depth represented 59%, total aboveground biomass 29%, total belowground biomass 10%, and necromass 2%. In secondary forests, TCS was 228.2Â Â±Â 13.1Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1, and soil organic carbon to 4Â m depth accounted for 84% of this amount. Total aboveground biomass represented only 9%, total belowground biomass 5%, and total necromass 1% of TCS in secondary forests. Monte Carlo methods were used to assess the uncertainty of the biomass measurements and spatial variation. Of the total uncertainty of the estimates of TCS, the variation associated with the spatial variation of C pools between plots was higher than measurement errors within plots. From this study it is concluded that estimates of aboveground biomass largely underestimate total carbon stocks in forest ecosystems. Additionally, it is suggested that heterogeneous landscapes impose additional challenges for their study such as sampling intensity.",

Hydrologically, the catchments are characterised by very low runoff rates, being 1-10% of rainfall. The work described here aimed to (1) obtain measurements of the various components of jarrah forest evapotranspiration during two contrasting seasons; (2) obtain measurements enabling determination of the components of the energy balance of the forest; and (3) test the hypothesis that these forests have established in these areas in part because they can access the deep soil water to maintain high evaporation rates in the summer months and avoid significant water stress. The results of these measurements are to be used in validation and parameterisation of a model to be described in a separate paper. Measurements of the energy and water balance of this system were taken during 10 days in spring and late summer. Total forest evaporation, tree water use, sensible heat flux above the 25Â m canopy and at 2Â m above the forest floor, forest floor evaporation, soil heat flux and temperature profiles, canopy heat storage and radiation above and below the canopy were measured.Despite a reduction of leaf area by one-third of the spring value and a reduction of 30% in soil moisture, the forest maintained high leaf conductances during summer, with evapotranspiration rates at around or above 78% of equilibrium evapotranspiration in both seasons. On average, total water use by the trees was slightly, but not significantly, greater in summer than spring (2.8 and 2.5Â mm per day, respectively), and in summer soil evaporation was about half its spring rate (0.27Â mm per day compared with 0.48Â mm per day). Short-wave radiation penetration through the canopy was found to be the same in spring as it was in summer (being 35% of overstorey radiation), despite a 30% reduction in leaf area index (1.32-0.88) from spring to summer. This is probably due to the significance of tree trunks and branches intercepting radiation, relative to the relatively sparse canopy, and the greater component of diffuse radiation during spring. Canopy heat storage, was found to be a significant component in the total hourly energy budget. During the first three daylight hours it was 45% of net radiation, Rn, in spring and 69% in summer. During the last three daylight hours the proportions were -17 and -19% in spring and summer, respectively. The data presented illustrate important considerations for modelling this forest system and others like it. The importance of a deep soil profile which retains moisture from winter rainfall of this Mediterranean climate, and provides the forest with an adequate supply through the long dry summer is clearly significant. Canopy conductance must be linked to the availability of moisture from the deep soil profile throughout the dry summer. The forest also appears to have adapted to its climate in such a way as to maximise water use despite seasonal fluctuations in leaf area, although we only have data from a single seasonal cycle.",

We used a long-term tropical reforestation project (55-61 yr) to estimate rates of above- and belowground C sequestration and to investigate the impact of planted species on overall plant community structure. Thirteen tree species (nine native and four nonnative species) were planted as part of the reforestation effort in the mid to late 1930s. In 1992, there were 75 tree species (>9.1 cm dbh) in the forest. Overall, planted species accounted for 40% of the importance value of the forest; planted nonnative species contributed only 5% of the importance value. In the reforested ecosystem, the total soil C pool (0-60 cm depth) was larger than the aboveground C pool, and there was more soil C in the forest (102 Â± 10 Mg/ha [mean Â± 1 se]) than in an adjacent pasture of similar age (69 Â± 16 Mg/ha). Forest soil C (C3-C) increased at a rate of ~0.9 MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, but residual pasture C (C4-C) was lost at a rate of 0.4 MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, yielding a net gain of 33 Mg/ha as a result of 61 years of forest regrowth. Aboveground C accumulated at a rate of 1.4 Â± 0.05 MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, to a total of 80 Â± 3 Mg/ha. A survey of 426 merchantable trees in 1959 and 1992 showed that they grew faster in the second 33 years of forest development than in the first 22 years, indicating that later stages of forest development can play an important role in C sequestration. Few indices of C cycling were correlated with plant community composition or structure. Our results indicate that significant soil C can accumulate with reforestation and that there are strong legacies of pasture use and reforestation in plant community structure and rates of plant C sequestration.

Destructive sampling was done at two further sites to obtain data on tree form and biomass. Total dry matter, including that on the forest floor, ranged from 132 to 2290 t ha-1, with as much as 546 t ha-1 of forest floor litter and humus in the oldest stand. Total stored carbon above the mineral soil ranged from 64 to 990 t ha-1. Litter fall was collected monthly in five 1-m2 litter traps at each site for two years. Total annual litter fall ranged from 4.5 to 13.2 t ha-1 with leaf litter making up 41% or less, by weight, of the total litter fall. Forest floor accumulation of litter in kauri forest is extremely high with mean residence time of 9-78 years. In general, sites with higher litter fall are accompanied by faster breakdown, but at all sites litter decomposition is slow. Leaf area index (LA) of light-suppressed saplings and poles ranged from 0.08 to 0.84, whereas young emergent trees had LA of 3.33-3.66. LA of mature trees, estimated from litter fall and mean leafage, was 1.0-3.0, with a new foliage increment of 0.4-0.9 LA per annum. A simple biomass and production model for two mature kauri site shows a wide variation in production. For Trounson Forest, a site with mature trees, the net production is c. 8.5 t ha-1 yr-1 with 2.4 t allocated to wood, 2 t to roots, and 4.1 t to replacing litter fall. For a younger stand on farmland at Kaipara Flats, net production is c. 15 t ha-1 yr-1 with 11.1 t allocated to replacing litter fall. ",

Soil respiration, soil temperature, and organic layer thickness were measured at 100 points in a grid pattern of 2 m x 2 m at each site in 2004 and 2005. The mean within-site spatial coefficient of variation was 35%, and the measurements were not spatially autocorrelated. We found no significant difference in variance between the two youngest sites (PÂ > 0.05), whereas the older site showed significantly lower variance (PÂ < 0.05). Soil respiration was not correlated with the forest floor organic layer thickness at any of the sites (R2Â < 0.1). Removal of the forest floor layer reduced the soil respiration by 17% to 38%, depending on the site. Thus, the respiration from the mineral soil seemed to contribute a major fraction of the total soil respiration (62%-83%). Soil respiration was positively linearly related to the fine root biomass (R2 = 0.63-0.85, PÂ < 0.05) at all sites.

In a number of studies using single tree species, fine root biomass has been shown to be strongly increased by elevated CO2. However, natural forests are often intimate mixtures of a number of co-occurring species. To investigate the interaction between tree mixture and elevated CO2, Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula and Fagus sylvatica were planted in areas of single species and a three species polyculture in a free-air CO2 enrichment study (BangorFACE). The trees were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 (580Â ÂµmolÂ mol-1) for 4Â years. Fine and coarse root biomass, together with fine root turnover and fine root morphological characteristics were measured. Fine root biomass and morphology responded differentially to the elevated CO2 at different soil depths in the three species when grown in monocultures. In polyculture, a greater response to elevated CO2 was observed in coarse roots to a depth of 20Â cm, and fine root area index to a depth of 30Â cm. Total fine root biomass was positively affected by elevated CO2 at the end of the experiment, but not by species diversity. Our data suggest that existing biogeochemical cycling models parameterized with data from species grown in monoculture may be underestimating the belowground response to global change. ",

The potential, upper bound to C storage is difficult to approximate in the field because it requires studying old-growth forests, of which few remain. In this paper, we put an upper bound (or limit) on C storage in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States using field data from old-growth forests, which are near steady-state conditions. Specifically, the goals of this study were: (1) to approximate the upper bounds of C storage in the PNW by estimating total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stores of 43 old-growth forest stands in five distinct biogeoclimatic provinces and (2) to compare these TEC storage estimates with those from other biomes, globally. Finally, we suggest that the upper bounds of C storage in forests of the PNW are higher than current estimates of C stores, presumably due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which indicates a potentially substantial and economically significant role of C sequestration in the region. Results showed that coastal Oregon stands stored, on average, 1127 Mg C/ha, which was the highest for the study area, while stands in eastern Oregon stored the least, 195 Mg C/ha. In general, coastal Oregon stands stored 307 Mg C/ha more than coastal Washington stands. Similarly, the Oregon Cascades stands stored 75 Mg C/ha more, on average, than the Washington Cascades stands. A simple, area-weighted average TEC storage to 1 m soil depth (TEC100) for the PNW was 671 Mg C/ha. When soil was included only to 50 cm (TEC50), the area-weighted average was 640 Mg C/ha. Subtracting estimates of current forest C storage from the potential, upper bound of C storage in this study, a maximum of 338 Mg C/ha (TEC100) could be stored in PNW forests in addition to current stores.

There was no significant change in soil organic C and N concentrations among the three types at the three soil depths, and soil organic C and N increases were confined to the topsoil (0-10Â cm). Soil CO2 evolution tracked seasonal soil temperature, however, there was no difference among conversion types. Annual soil CO2 evolution (Mg CO2/ha/yr) was 36.0Â±3.7 for the rice field conversion to forest site, 33.8Â±4.1 for the crop field conversion to shrub site, and 40.7Â±4.1 for the indigenous forest site, respectively. After decomposing for one year, 55.8% for the rice field conversion site, 64.9% for the crop field conversion site, and 66.3% for the indigenous forest site of the original leaf litter mass remained. The soil moisture condition seemed to limit the rate of decomposition in the study area. Resin concentration was higher at the rice field conversion site. ",

The soil CO2 flux in both forest types showed similar daily and seasonal dynamic patterns with the highest soil CO2 efflux at 14:00-16:00 in summer and the lowest in winter.

To better understand the gamut of these issues, all land use pathways that lead to fire use and culminate in different fire types must be investigated. An estimated 400,000 smallholders use fire in their land use practices, but most research has investigated connections between land use decisions and subsequent fire on large-scale cattle ranches only. This study presents research on smallholder fire use practices in the agricultural frontier south of Santarem, Para. Vegetation vulnerable to smallholder fires is largely secondary succession, while only ~8% is logged or mature forest cover. Fire efficiency in smallholder fire use practices is slightly higher than in previous studies used to estimate regional biomass burning, averaging 46.7-57.5%. In slashed succession areas, average efficiency also increases as biomass fuel load increases, but range increases as well, suggesting that smallholders may have more control over efficiency outcome in younger slashed succession areas than older slashed succession, logged areas or mature forests.",

The mean rate of efflux was 6.45Â±0.25 SE Âµmol CO2 m-2s-1 at 25.6Â±0.22 SEÂ°C (5 cm depth) ranging from 4.35 to 9.76 Âµmol CO2 m-2s-1; diel changes in efflux were correlated with soil temperature (r2=0.60). However, the efflux response to the diel cycle in temperature was not always a clear exponential function. During period of low soil water content, temperature in deeper layers had a better relationship with CO2 efflux than with the temperature nearer the soil surface. Soil water content may limit CO2 production during the drying-down period that appeared to be an important factor controlling the efflux rate (r2=0.39). On the other hand, during the rewetting period microbial activity may be the main controlling factor, which may quickly induce very high rates of efflux. The CO2 flux chamber was adapted to mimic the effects of rainfall on soil CO2 efflux and the results showed that efflux rates reduced 30% immediately after a rainfall event. Measurements of the CO2 concentration gradient in the soil profile showed a buildup in the concentration of CO2 after rain on the top soil. This higher CO2 concentration developed shortly after rainfall when the soil pores in the upper layers were filled with water, which created a barrier for gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere.

Average CO2 efflux was 21% higher for sand (3.93Â Â±Â 0.06Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1) than for the clay (3.08Â Â±Â 0.07Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-2Â s-1).

Soil CO2 efflux did not differ between dry and wet season, but we detected a significant interaction between season and topographic position. The variation caused by topography was in the same order of magnitude as temporal variation. Mean contribution of the litter layer to the CO2 efflux rates was 20% and varied from 25% during the wet season to close to 0% during the dry season. The relation between soil water content and soil CO2 efflux showed an optimum for both soil textures but the shape and optimum of the curves were different. The results of our study illustrate that soil moisture is an important driver of temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux in this old-growth forest. When extrapolating soil CO2 efflux to larger areas, the significant influences of soil texture, litter, and the interaction of topographical position and time illustrate that it is necessary to include some of the complexity of landscapes.",

Here, we report how a throughfall exclusion (TFE) experiment affected soil carbon dioxide (CO2) production in a deeply weathered sandy Oxisol of Caxiuano (Eastern Amazon). Over the course of 2 years, we measured soil CO2 efflux and soil CO2 concentrations, soil temperature and moisture in pits down to 3 m depth. Over a period of 2 years, TFE reduced on average soil CO2 efflux from 4.3Â±0.1 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (control) to 3.2Â±0.1 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 (TFE). The contribution of the subsoil (below 0.5 m depth) to the total soil CO2 production was higher in the TFE plot (28%) compared with the control plot (17%), and it did not differ between years. We distinguished three phases of drying after the TFE was started. The first phase was characterized by a translocation of water uptake (and accompanying root activity) to deeper layers and not enough water stress to affect microbial activity and/or total root respiration. During the second phase a reduction in total soil CO2 efflux in the TFE plot was related to a reduction of soil and litter decomposers activity. The third phase of drying, characterized by a continuing decrease in soil CO2 production was dominated by a water stress-induced decrease in total root respiration. Our results contrast to results of a drought experiment on clay Oxisols, which may be related to differences in soil water retention characteristics and depth of rooting zone. These results show that large differences exist in drought sensitivity among Amazonian forest ecosystems, which primarily seem to be affected by the combined effects of texture (affecting water holding capacity) and depth of rooting zone.

Changes in density, biomass, productivity, litterfall, and nutrient content of the vegetation over the course of stand development were documented in a series of these stands on Whiteface Mountain, New York. After a regeneration wave passes through an area and the overstory dies, formerly suppressed seedlings are released, and stand density increases to 10-13 trees/m2 at about age 10 (counting only stems over 25 cm tall). Stand density then begins to decrease, at first slowly but then more rapidly, with a maximum mortality rate of 20-25% yr between years 20 and 30. Thereafter mortality continues, but the rate decreases over time to Ëœ4% yr at age 55. After about age 20 the relationship between stand age and stand density is p = 0.04 Â· exp(115/AGE). For stands that have begun to self-thin, the relationship between stand age and stand density and mean aboveground tree mass is log10 m = 3.94 - 1.24 log10p, with a slope significantly different from -1.5. Basal area (measured at 25 cm) increases for the first 15-20 yr of stand development, then remains constant at 60-70 m2/ha for the remainder of the life of the stand. Total aboveground biomass of a mature fir stand is Ëœ11.8 kg/m2 (1.5 kg/m2 foliage, 1.7 kg/m2 branches, 0.9 kg/m2 bole bark, and 7.7 kg/m2 bole wood). The biomass accumulation rate is highest during the first decade of stand development (320 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1), and declines to Ëœ115 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1 for a 55-yr-old stand. Foliage biomass increases rapidly during the first 10-15 yr of stand development, then remains constant after crown closure. Branch biomass increases until about age 15, declines for about a decade, then increases again for the rest of the life of the stand. Bole bark increases until about age 30, then stabilizes. Bole wood continues to increase throughout the life of the stand. Aboveground net primary productivity for a mature stand is 960 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1 (foliage, 380 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1; twigs, 150 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1; branch wood and bark, 170 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1; bole bark, 25 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1; and bole wood, 235 g Â· m-2 Â· yr-1). Productivity remains generally constant as the stand develops, but in the early stages almost 45% of the total aboveground production is devoted to producing bole wood and bark, while in a mature stand this proportion drops to Ëœ25%, with the remainder going to foliage and branch wood production. There is thus a shift from production of boles to branches as the stand ages. This may reflect a shift in the primary stresses on the trees, from intraspecific competition in the younger stands to physical environmental factors (e.g., wind abrasion and rime formation) in the older stands. After the initial increase, woody tissue respiration remains approximately constant throughout the life of the stand, as an increase in the size and height of boles is balanced by death of small trees and a decrease in total bole surface area. A mature fir stand contains nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, and calcium in the amounts 47.7, 18.1, 4.6, and 30.4 g/m2, respectively. All these nutrients accumulate rapidly in the early stages of stand development as the stand accumulates nutrient-rich foliage. This is particularly true for nitrogen; a 9-yr-old stand contains half as much nitrogen as a 60-yr-old one. However, the difference between nutrient uptake by the trees and nutrient release in decomposition is greatest somewhat later in stand development, when the pulse of litter accompanying stand die-off has decomposed but the young stand is still taking up significantly greater quantities of nutrients than it is returning in litterfall. Thus if ecosystem nutrient losses are controlled by nutrient accumulation in living biomass, the period of maximum nutrient conservation should occur in the years immediately after disturbance, when the stand is accumulating nutrients most rapidly. If the critical factor is the balance between uptake and release, then minimum losses should occur later. Increased meteorologic inputs of nitrogen and acid in the high-altitude fir forests may have altered the natural nutrient cycles of the preindustrial era. ",

We examined the main environmental factors controlling growth and resource use across a geographic gradient with clonal E. grandis x urophylla in north-eastern Brazil. Rates of production and resource use were estimated for 14 stands that spanned a four-fold range in production. The supply of water appeared to be the most limiting resource in these fertilized plantations. Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) increased by 2.3Â MgÂ ha-1 per year for each 100Â mm per year increase in rainfall. Higher water supply was also associated with increased use of light and nitrogen (N). The efficiency of resource use (ANPP per unit of resource used) increased with increasing productivity along the gradient.

The stands with high resource use and high efficiency also had lower mean vapor pressure deficits, less soil water stress, and smaller coarse root to above-ground biomass ratios. Our study indicates that the productivity of fertilized tropical plantations of Eucalyptus is most likely constrained by water supply, and that water supply substantially affects the efficiency of resource use as well as biomass allocation to roots, stems, and leaves. At a regional scale, our results indicate that high productivity stands could produce wood in a 6-year rotation on half the land area required for low productivity stands, using only half as much water.",

Productivity measures included gross primary production (GPP), total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA), bole growth, and net ecosystem production (NEP). Replicate plots within a single plantation were established at the midpoint of the rotation (end of year 3), with treatments of no additional fertilization or irrigation, heavy fertilization (to remove any nutrient limitation), irrigation (to remove any water limitation), and irrigation plus fertilization. Rainfall was unusually high in the first year (1769Â mm) of the experiment, and control plots had high rates of GPP (6.64Â kgÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), TBCA (2.14Â kgÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1), and bole growth (1.81Â kgÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1).

Fertilization treatments had neglible effects. The response to irrigation was much greater in the drier year, with irrigated plots exceeding the production in control plots by 83% (GPP), 239% (TBCA), and 24% (bole growth). Even though the rate of irrigation ensured no water limitation to tree growth, the high rainfall year showed higher production in irrigated plots for both GPP (38% greater than in drier year) and bole growth (23% greater). Varying humidity and supplies of water led to a range in NEP of 0.8-2.7Â kgÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1. This difference between control and irrigated treatments, combined with differences between drier and wetter years, indicated a strong response of these Eucalyptus trees to both water supply and atmospheric humidity during the dry season. The efficiency of converting light energy into fixed carbon ranged from a low of 0.027Â mol C to a high of 0.060Â mol C per mol of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and the efficiency of bolewood production ranged from 0.78 to 1.98Â g wood per MJ of APAR.

The climate of the Southern Study Area (SSA) near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan is warmer and drier in the summer and milder in the winter than the Northern Study Area (NSA) near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. Ingrowth soil cores and minirhizotrons were used to quantify fine root net primary production (NPPFR). Average daily fine root growth (m m-2 day-1) was positively correlated with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (r2 = 0.83-0.93) for all three species, with black spruce showing the strongest temperature effect. At both study areas, fine root biomass (measured from soil cores) and fine root length (measured from minirhizotrons) were less for jack pine than for the other two species. Except for the aspen stands, estimates of NPPFR from minirhizotrons were significantly greater than estimates from ingrowth cores. The core method underestimated NPPFR because it does not account for simultaneous fine root growth and mortality. Minirhizotron NPPFR estimates ranged from 59 g m-2 year-1 for aspen stands at SSA to 235 g m-2 year-1 for black spruce at NSA. The ratio of NPPFR to total detritus production (aboveground litterfall + NPPFR) was greater for evergreen forests than for deciduous forests, suggesting that carbon allocation patterns differ between boreal evergreen and deciduous forests. In all stands, NPPFR consistently exceeded annual fine root turnover and the differences were larger for stands in the NSA than for stands in the SSA, whereas the difference between study areas was only significant for black spruce. The imbalance between NPPFR and fine root turnover is sufficient to explain the net accumulation of carbon in boreal forest soils.",

Structural measurements were made in a series of secondary forest stands, from 4-30 y old, in Brazil and Bolivia. Half of the stands were forest regrowth following clearance and only 1 y of cultivation; the other half were regrowth following 4 y or more of continuous pasture in Brazil and three or more rotations of medium-fallow agriculture in Bolivia. Above-ground live biomass was estimated using published allometric equations. Total biomass ranged from 17 to 207 Mg ha-1. Biomass of pioneer trees was poorly related to stand age, while that of later-successional trees increased linearly with age. Total biomass accumulation in Bolivia averaged 5.4 Mg ha-1 y-1 over the entire age sequence. Biomass accumulation for regrowth following short-term use was not greater than that for regrowth following medium-fallow agriculture. In Brazil, biomass accumulation averaged 9.1 Mg ha-1 y-1 over the first 12 y of regrowth and 5.9 Mg ha-1 y-1 over the entire age sequence. Biomass accumulation was significantly slower, around 5.0 Mg ha-1 y-1, for regrowth following continuous pasture than for regrowth following 1 y of cultivation.",

To determine the sensitivity of soil carbon fluxes to changes in temperature and moisture, we quantified seasonal and spatial variability of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes (NÂ =Â 746) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate (NÂ =Â 260) in high-elevation, mixed conifer forests in Arizona and New Mexico. All sites have cold winters, warm summers, and bimodal soil moisture patterns associated with snowmelt and summer monsoon rainfall. We employed a state factor approach, quantifying how distal controls (parent material, regional climate, topography) interacted with proximal variability in soil temperature (-3 to 26Â Â°C) and moisture (2-76Â %) to influence carbon effluxes. Carbon loss was dominated by CO2 flux (250-1220Â g CÂ m-2Â year-1) rather than leached DOC (7.0-9.4Â g C m-2Â year-1). Significant differences in mean growing season CO2 flux were associated with parent material and aspect; differences appear to be mediated by how these distal controls influence primarily moisture and secondarily temperature. Across all sites, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) relying on moisture and temperature best described growing season CO2 fluxes (r2Â =Â 0.63, pÂ <Â 0.001). During winter, the MLR describing soil CO2 flux (r2Â =Â 0.98, pÂ <Â 0.001) relied on distal factors including snow cover, clay content, and bulk carbon, all factors that influence liquid water content. Our findings highlight the importance of state factors in controlling soil respiration primarily through influencing spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil moisture.",

Our analyses demonstrate that the more complex FPMs, particularly the â€˜non-rectangular hyperbolic method', consistently produced the most reasonable C flux estimates. Of the FPMs that use nighttime data to estimate RE, one that parameterized an exponential model over short time periods generated predictions that were closer to expected flux values. To explore how much â€˜new information' was injected into the data by the FPMs, we used formal information theory methods and computed the Shannon entropy for: (1) the probability density, to assess alterations to the flux measurement distributions, and (2) the wavelet energy spectra, to assess alterations to the internal autocorrelation within the NEE time series. Based on this joint analysis, gap-filling had little impact on the IC of daytime data, but gap-filling significantly altered nighttime data in both the probability and wavelet spectral domains.",

The resulting data set contained a large amount of temporally highly resolved information on the variation in soil CO2 efflux together with environmental variables. Based on this background, the dependencies of the soil CO2 efflux rate on the controlling environmental factors were analysed in-depth. Of the abiotic factors, soil temperature alone explained 72% of the variation in the efflux rate, and including soil water content (SWC) as an additional variable increased the explained variance to about 83%. Between April and December, average rates ranged from 0.43 to 5.15Â Âµmol CO2Â m-2Â s-1 (in November and July, respectively) with diurnal variations of up to 50% throughout the experiment. The variability in wind speed above the forest floor influenced the CO2 efflux rates for measuring locations with a litter layer of relatively low bulk density (and hence relatively high proportions of pore spaces). For the temporal integration of flux rates for time scales of hours to days, however, wind velocities were of no effect, reflecting the fact that wind forcing acts on the transport, but not the production of CO2 in the soil. The variation in both the magnitude of the basal respiration rate and the temperature sensitivity throughout the growing season was only moderate (coefficient of variation of 15 and 25%, respectively). Soil water limitation of the CO2 production in the soil could be best explained by a reduction in the temperature-insensitive basal respiration rate, with no discernible effect on the temperature sensitivity. Using a soil CO2 efflux model with soil temperature and SWC as driving variables, it was possible to calculate the annual soil CO2 efflux for four consecutive years for which meteorological data were available. These simulations indicate an average efflux sum of 560 g CÂ m-2Â yr-1 (SE=22 g CÂ m-2Â yr-1). An alternative model derived from the same data but using temperature alone as a driver over-estimated the annual flux sum by about 7% and showed less inter-annual variability. Given a likely shift in precipitation patterns alongside temperature changes under projected global change scenarios, these results demonstrate the necessity to include soil moisture in models that calculate the evolution of CO2 from temperate forest soils.",

The experimental approach combined the placement of labelled litter (d13C=-37.9â€°) with forest girdling in a 35-year-old Norway spruce stand, resulting in four different treatment combinations: GL (girdled, litter), GNL (girdled, no litter), NGL (not girdled, litter), and NGNL (not girdled, no litter). Monthly sampling of soil CO2 efflux and d13C of soil respired CO2 between May and October 2002 allowed the partitioning of the flux into that derived from the labelled litter, and that derived from native soil organic matter and roots. The effect of forest girdling on soil CO2 efflux was detectable from June (girdling took place in April), and resulted in GNL fluxes to be about 50% of NGNL fluxes by late August. The presence of litter resulted in significantly increased fluxes for the first 2Â months of the experiment, with significantly greater litter derived fluxes from non-girdled plots and a significant interaction between girdling and litter treatments over the same period. For NGL collars, the additional efflux was found to originate only in part from litter decomposition, but also from the decay of native soil organic matter. In GL collars, this priming effect was not significant, indicating an active role of the rhizosphere in soil priming. The results therefore indicate mutual positive feedbacks between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity. Soil biological analysis (microbial and fungal biomass) of the organic layers indicated greatest activity below NGL collars, and we suppose that this increase indicates the mechanism of mutual positive feedback between rhizosphere activity and litter decomposition. However, elimination of fresh C input from both above- and belowground (GNL) also resulted in greater fungal abundance than for the NGNL treatment, indicating likely changes in fungal community structure (i.e. a shift from symbiotic to saprotrophic species abundance).",

Carbon dioxide is released from soil to the atmosphere as a result of plant root and microbial respiration. Additionally, soils in dry forests are often sinks of methane from the atmosphere. Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases whose increasing concentration in the atmosphere contributes to climate warming. Thinning treatments are being implemented in ponderosa pine forests across the southwestern United States to restore historic forest structure and reduce the risk of severe wildfire. This study addresses how thinning alters fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane in ponderosa pine forest soils within one year of management and examines mechanisms of change. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, soil temperature, soil water content, forest floor mass, root mass, understory plant biomass, and soil microbial biomass carbon were measured before and after the implementation of a thinning and in an unthinned forest. Carbon dioxide efflux from soil decreased as a result of thinning in two of three summer months. Average summer carbon dioxide efflux declined by an average of 34Â mgÂ CÂ m-2Â hr-1 in the first year after thinning. Methane oxidation did not change in response to thinning. Thinning had no significant short-term effect on total forest floor mass, total root biomass, or microbial biomass carbon in the mineral soil. Understory plant biomass increased after thinning. Thinning increased carbon available for decomposition by killing tree roots, but our results suggest that thinning reduced carbon dioxide emissions from the soil because the reduction in belowground autotrophic respiration was larger than the stimulation of heterotrophic respiration. Methane oxidation was probably not affected by thinning because thinning did not alter the forest floor mass enough to affect methane diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil.",

We present soil CO2 efflux data from a gradient of disturbance to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests in northern Arizona, USA that were obtained using four different techniques: vented static chambers, a Licor 6400-09, and soil CO2 diffusion profiles using two different models (Moldrup, Millington-Quirk) to estimate soil gas diffusivity. We also compared soil CO2 efflux measured by the Moldrup and Millington-Quirk diffusion profile methods to nighttime total ecosystem respiration (TER) data from an eddy covariance tower. We addressed four questions: (1) Does the use of a given method to measure soil CO2 efflux bias results across a disturbance gradient? (2) Does the magnitude of difference between observed and modeled estimates of soil CO2 differ between methods and across sites? (3) What is the spatial variability of each method at each site? (4) Which method is closest to the estimate of TER measured by the eddy covariance tower? Although soil CO2 efflux varied significantly among methods the differences were consistent among sites. Measured and modeled total growing season fluxes were generally higher for the Licor 6400-09 and Millington-Quirk diffusion gradient methods compared with static chamber and the Moldrup diffusion gradient methods. A power analysis showed that the larger static chamber was the most efficient method at sampling spatial variation in soil CO2 efflux. Nighttime measurements of soil CO2 efflux from the Moldrup diffusion gradient method were most strongly related to nighttime TER assessed with eddy covariance. The use of a single, well-implemented method to measure soil CO2 efflux is unlikely to create bias in comparisons across a gradient of forest disturbance. ",

Mean annual litterfall in the study sites ranged from 5.63 to 8.65Â MgÂ ha-1 year-1. A greater amount of annual litter production was observed in sites II and III, when compared to sites I and IV. This variation in litterfall pattern among the sites could be attributed to species composition. Monthly variation in litterfall pattern showed two peaks, one in the dry season (January-April) and another in November. Contribution of leaf litter to the total litter was significantly (pÂ <Â 0.01) greater compared to other components (woody litter and reproductive parts). In deciduous forests, Terminalia contributed significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) greater amount of leaf litter to annual litter production, followed by Careya arborea, Macaranga peltata, Aporosa lindleyana and Dillenia pentagyna, whereas in evergreen forests, Hopea parviflora contributed the most. The results suggest that species composition and their contribution toward litter becomes important in overall community or site litter production as observed in sites II and III. The litter mass decreased linearly with time. Thin and smooth leaf without prominent skeletal tissues decomposed more rapidly, while thick and tough leaves with prominent midribs and veins took longer time for complete decomposition. The species with high nitrogen content exhibited relatively faster decomposition except in H. parviflora and V. indica. The differences in decay rates and half-life periods are related to structure and nutrient concentration of leaf litter and the environmental factors.",

The analysis was based on a 5-year-long time series of CO2 flux measured from April 1996 to April 2001 in a Scots pine forest in southern Finland by the eddy covariance technique. The onset of the ecosystem growing season was best connected with air temperature, and the end of the growing season was best connected with day length. With these variables we were able to predict the timing and the length of each growing season within 0-3 days. The forest was a sink of carbon with little interannual variability: The uptake during the four full growing seasons varied by 80 g C m-2, ranging from 230 to 310 g C m-2. The estimated winter release each year varied between 60 and 90 g C m-2. The interannual variation in seasonal (spring, summer, autumn) carbon exchange ranged from 30 g C m-2 in autumn and spring to 80 g C m-2 in summer. The average climatic variables explained the variability of the seasonal or growing-season cumulative NEE only partly. Both the daytime and the nighttime CO2 fluxes contributed markedly to the variability in carbon exchange, indicating that photosynthesis and respiration have an equally important influence on NEE.

The stand's density, survival and growth parameters (DBH, total height, crown diameter and number of branches) varied significantly with age and site. The number of stems was highest (789trees/ha) in a 1-year-old plantation at site 3 (Kusumi) and lowest (724trees/ha) in a 6-year-old stand at site 2 (Anandgoan). Allometric equations for stem wood, branches, leaves and roots to tree diameter at breast height were developed to estimate above ground and below ground tree biomass.

The aboveground mass of planted legumes, trees, herbaceous vegetation, and litter and root mass were measured at 4, 8, 17, 29, 41, and 53 months after fallow initiation; leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured at 4, 8, and 17 months. After 8 months, total mass in the IE, CC, and DO treatments was significantly greater than in the CM and PP treatments; total mass in the natural fallow (NF) treatment was similar to that in the IE, CC, and DO treatments after 29 months. Aboveground biomass contributed about 75-85% of total mass and was greater when trees were present. Aboveground biomass ranged from 8 (CM) to 63 t ha-1 (IE) at 53 months. Planted legume biomass in most treatments increased until 17 or 29 months, but later declined when many of the legumes were replaced by invading trees. By 53 months, planted legume biomass represented less than 10% of aboveground mass in all treatments except CM and IE. The LAI increased from 4 to 17 months, but there were few differences among treatments at any date; LAD greatly decreased with time in the treatments with trees. The formation and maintenance of dense vegetation canopies with high LAD in the CM, SC, and PP treatments inhibited the invasion and growth of trees. Biomass data at 53 months suggest that the IE and DO treatments accumulated similar amounts of biomass and litter as the NF treatment because of the rapid establishment of planted legumes and the successful invasion of trees and that the CM, SC, and PP treatments performed poorly because of the exclusion of trees. Further research combining trees and other leguminous or non-leguminous vegetation is required to develop management practices that maximize biomass accumulation during managed fallows.",

The mixed forest was a weak carbon sink (net ecosystem exchange, -44 g C m-2 yr-1), and it became a large carbon source (569 g C m-2 yr-1) after clearcutting. However, the large emission in the harvest year rapidly decreased in the following 2 years (495 and 153 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively) as the gross primary production (GPP) increased, while the total ecosystem respiration (RE) remained relatively stable. The rapid increase in GPP was attributed to an increase in biomass and photosynthetic activity of Sasa dwarf bamboo, an understory species. Soil respiration increased in the 3 years following clearcutting, in the first year mainly owing to the change in the gap ratio of the forest, and in the following years because of increased root respiration by the bamboo. The ratio of soil respiration to RE increased from 44% in the forest to nearly 100% after clearcutting, and aboveground parts of the vegetation contributed little to the RE although the respiration chamber measurements showed heterogeneous soil condition after clearcutting.

In Kanchanaburi, western Thailand, we measured the soil respiration rates at different slope positions-ridge (plot R), upper slope (plot U), and lower slope (plot L)-on a hill in a seasonal tropical forest [mixed deciduous forest (MDF)] to determine the seasonal and spatial variations in soil respiration on the slope. The heterotrophic (organic layer and soil) and autotrophic (root) respiration was differentiated by trenching. Soil respiration rates showed clear seasonal patterns: high and low rates in rainy and dry seasons respectively, at all plots, and tended to decrease up the slope. Soil respiration rates responded significantly to soil water content in the 0-30 cm layer, but the response patterns differed between the lower slope (plot L) and the upper slope (plots R and U): a linear model could be applied to the lower slope but exponential quadratic models to the upper slope. The annual carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from the forest floor was also associated with the slope position and ranged from 1908 gC m-2 year-1 in plot L to 1199 gC m-2 year-1 in plot R. With ascending position from plot L to R, the contribution of autotrophic respiration increased from 19.4 to 36.6% of total soil respiration, while that of the organic layer decreased from 26.2 to 9.4%. Mineral soil contributed to 46.3 to 54.4% of the total soil respiration. Soil water content was the key factor in controlling the soil respiration rate and the contribution of the respiration sources. However, the variable responses of soil respiration to soil water content create a complex distribution of soil respiration at the watershed scale. ",

Soil temperature and moisture were higher at the two disturbed sites than at the forest site. A 64-72% decrease in the Q 10 value of soil CO2 flux from the disturbed sites compared with the forest site (5.92) suggested a reduction in root respiration and a dominance of organic matter decomposition at the disturbed sites. However, the cumulative CO2 emissions (May-August) were not significantly different among the sites (2.81-2.90Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1 per 3Â months). This might be because decreased larch root respiration was compensated for by increased organic matter decomposition resulting from an increase in the temperature and root respiration of invading vegetation at the disturbed sites. The CH4 uptake (kgÂ CÂ ha-1 per 4Â months [May-September]) at the burnt site was significantly higher (-0.15) than the uptake at the forest (-0.045) and clear-felled sites (0.0027).

This different influence of burning and tree felling on CH4 and N2O fluxes might result from changes in the physical and chemical properties of the soil with respect to forest fire. ",

In the evergreen forest with common brown forest soil, soil properties had the greatest effect on soil respiration rates, followed by soil moisture and soil temperature. These results may be explained by the fact that different soil properties matured within different environments. It can be argued that the low soil respiration rates in the low parts of the slope in the evergreen forest resulted from soil properties and not from wet soil conditions. In the deciduous forest, soil respiration rates were more strongly affected by soil moisture and soil temperature than by soil properties. These effects were likely due to the immaturity of the forest soil. ",

Biometric- and eddy covariance-based net ecosystem production showed no convergence in our investigation period.

Consequently, there are fewer scientific studies on old-growth forests. The eddy covariance method has been widely used as an alternative approach to studying an ecosystem's carbon balance, but only a few eddy flux sites are located in old-growth forest. This fact will hinder our ability to test hypotheses such as whether or not old-growth forests are carbon neutral. The eddy covariance approach was used to examine the carbon balance of a 300-year-old subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest that is located in the center of the largest subtropical land area in the world. The post-QA/QC (quality assurance and control) eddy covariance based NEP was ~ 9Â tC ha-1 yr-1, which suggested that this forest acts as a large carbon sink. The inventory data within the footprint of the eddy flux show that ~6Â tC ha-1 yr-1 was contributed by biomass and necromass. The large-and-old trees sequestered carbon. Approximately 60% of the biomass increment is contributed by the growth of large trees (DBHÂ >Â 60Â cm). The high-altitude-induced low temperature and the high diffusion-irradiation ratio caused by cloudiness were suggested asÂ two reasons for the large carbon sink in the forest we studied. To analyze the complex structure and terrain of this old-growth forest, this study suggested that biometric measurements carried out simultaneously with eddy flux measurements were necessary.",

We measured soil respiration in three treatments (control, trenching, litter removal) over 15 months. The annual total soil respiration (1248 gC m-2 yr-1) showed considerable spatial variation (coefficient of variation = 27.8%) within the forest. Thirty samples were required to obtain results within 10% of the mean value at a 95% confidential level. A distinctive cosine-like diel pattern of soil respiration was observed; the time lag between gross primary production and soil respiration at this scale was calculated to be 4-5 h. Seasonality of soil respiration was strong (~1 Âµmol m-2 s-1 near the end of winter; ~6 Âµmol m-2 s-1 in midsummer). No time lag was discerned between gross primary production and soil respiration at the seasonal scale. Soil temperature at 5 cm below surface can explain most (>91%) of the observed annual variation in soil respiration. The apparent respiration temperature sensitivity index (Q10) was 3.05. The lowest Q10 value was observed in winter, when soil moisture was low. Soil respiration was overestimated by a Q10 function during both dry and wet periods. The relative contributions of soil organic matter (RSOM), litterfall decomposition (RL), and root respiration (RR) to total soil respiration are 65.25%, 18.73%, and 16.01%, respectively; the temperature sensitivity of these components differ: RL (Q10 = 7.22) > RSOM (2.73) > RR (1.65). This relationship between Q10 values for litter respiration, soil organic matter decomposition, and root respiration still holds after minimizing the confounding effect of moisture. A relatively constant substrate supply and/or thermal acclimation could account for the observed low-temperature sensitivity in root respiration. Given the high carbon stocks and fluxes, the old-growth subtropical forests of China seem important in the global carbon budget and climate change. ",

Based on the measurement of soil CO2 profile and a gaseous diffusivity model, we estimated soil CO2 efflux, which was mainly from heterotrophic respiration, and its temporal variation in a dry season in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem in California. The daily mean values of CO2 concentrations in soils had small variation, but the diurnal variation was significant and correlated well with soil temperature. The daily mean CO2 concentration remained steady at 396Â ÂµmolÂ mol-1 at 2Â cm depth during the dry summer from days 200 to 235 in 2002. Over the same period, CO2 concentration decreased from 721 to 611Â ÂµmolÂ mol-1 at 8Â cm depth, and from 1044 to 871Â ÂµmolÂ mol-1 at 16Â cm. The vertical soil CO2 concentrations changed almost linearly with depth up to 16Â cm, but the gradient varied over time. Based on the soil CO2 gradient and the diffusion coefficient estimated from the Millington-Quirk model, continuous soil CO2 efflux was calculated. The daily mean values of CO2 efflux slightly decreased from 0.43 to 0.33Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 with a mean of 0.37Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1. The mean diurnal range of CO2 efflux was greater than the range of daily mean CO2 efflux within the study period. The diurnal variation of soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.32 to 0.45Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 with the peak value reached between 14:30 and 16:30Â h. This pattern corresponded well with the increase in soil temperatures during this time. By plotting CO2 efflux vs. soil temperature, we found that CO2 efflux correlated exponentially with soil temperature at the depth of 8Â cm, with R2 of 0.86 and Q10 of 1.27 in the summer dry season. The Q10 value increased with the depth of soil temperature measurements. The high correlation between CO2 efflux and temperature explains the diurnal pattern of CO2 efflux, but moisture may become another factor driving the seasonal pattern when moisture changes over seasons. The estimated CO2 efflux using this method was very close to chamber measurements, suggesting that this method can be used for long-term continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux.",

We continuously measured CO2 concentration at various depths in the soil and calculated surface CO2 efflux based on CO2 gradients and diffusivity in a young ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We determined soil respiration both in a control plot that included roots and in a trenched plot that had no roots. The difference between these plots was used to partition soil respiration into root respiration and heterotrophic respiration. We found that both CO2 concentration in the soil and surface CO2 efflux in the control plot were higher than in the trenched plot. The diurnal range of soil respiration in the trenched plot was larger than in the control. We observed dramatic pulses of soil respiration in response to rain events in summer and fall during the dry season. We modeled the seasonal variation in soil respiration without the pulses using soil temperature and moisture as driving variables and simulated soil respiration pulses using an exponential decay function in response to the volume of rain. Daily mean soil respiration peaked at 5.0Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the control and at 2.7Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the trenched plot in June before the rain pulses. Soil respiration increased from 4.9 to 8.2 and to 12.1Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 after the first and second rain events in the control, and increased from 2.2 to 4.1 and to 6.6Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the trenched plot. After incorporating the pulse effect, the model simulated measured data well. Annual soil respiration in 2003 was estimated as 1184Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1.

We took advantage of the unique spatial gradients of an oak-grass savanna ecosystem in California, with widely spaced oak trees overlying a grass layer, to study the spatial variation in soil respiration and to use these natural gradients to partition soil respiration according to its autotrophic and heterotrophic components. We measured soil respiration along a 42.5Â m transect between two oak trees in 2001 and 2002, and found that soil respiration under tree canopies decreased with distance from its base. In the open area, tree roots have no influence on soil respiration. Seasonally, soil respiration increased in spring until late April, and decreased in summer following the decrease in soil moisture content, despite the further increase in soil temperature. Soil respiration significantly increased following the rain events in autumn. During the grass growing season between November and mid-May, the average of CO2 efflux under trees was 2.29Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, while CO2 efflux from the open area was 1.40Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1. We deduced that oak root respiration averaged as 0.89Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, accounting for 39% of total soil respiration (oak rootÂ +Â grass rootÂ +Â microbes). During the dry season between mid-May and October, the average of CO2 efflux under trees was 0.87Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, while CO2 efflux from the open areas was 0.51Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1. Oak root respiration was 0.36Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, accounting for 41% of total soil respiration (oak rootÂ +Â microbes). The seasonal pattern of soil CO2 efflux under trees and in open areas was simulated by a bi-variable model driven by soil temperature and moisture. The diurnal pattern was influenced by tree physiology as well. Based on the spatial gradient of soil respiration, spatial analysis of crown closure and the simulation model, we spatially and temporally upscaled chamber measurements to the ecosystem scale. We estimated that the cumulative soil respiration in 2002 was 394Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 in the open area and 616Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1 under trees with a site-average of 488Â gCÂ m-2Â year-1.",

Soil respiration measured under a tree crown reflected the sum of rhizosphere respiration and heterotrophic respiration; soil respiration measured in an open area represented heterotrophic respiration. Soil respiration was measured using solid-state CO2 sensors buried in soils and the flux-gradient method. Canopy photosynthesis was obtained from overstory and understory flux measurements using the eddy covariance method. We found that the diurnal pattern of soil respiration in the open was driven by soil temperature, while soil respiration under the tree was decoupled with soil temperature. Although soil moisture controlled the seasonal pattern of soil respiration, it did not influence the diurnal pattern of soil respiration. Soil respiration under the tree controlled by the root component was strongly correlated with tree photosynthesis, but with a time lag of 7-12 h. These results indicate that photosynthesis drives soil respiration in addition to soil temperature and moisture. ",

We measured sap flux using Granier-type sensors in a northern hardwood-dominated old growth forest in Michigan, upscaled to canopy transpiration, and calculated canopy conductance. We also measured carbon and water fluxes with the eddy covariance method and derived daytime gross primary production (GPP). The diurnal patterns of sap flux and canopy transpiration were mainly controlled by vapor pressure deficit (D) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Daily sums of sap flux and canopy transpiration had exponential relationships to D that saturated at higher D and had linear relationships to PAR. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniesis) had higher sap flux per unit of sapwood area than eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), while sugar maple and hemlock had higher canopy transpiration per unit of leaf area than yellow birch. Sugar maple dominated canopy transpiration per ground area. Canopy transpiration averaged 1.57 mm d-1, accounting for 65% of total evapotranspiration in the growing season. Canopy conductance was controlled by both D and PAR, but the day-to-day variation in canopy conductance mainly followed a negatively logarithmic relationship with D. By removing the influences of PAR, half-hourly canopy conductance was also negatively logarithmically correlated with D. Water use efficiency (WUE) had a strong exponential relationship with D on a daily basis and approached a minimum of 4.4 mg g-1. WUE provides an alternative to estimate GPP from measurements of sap flux. ",

We measured ecosystem respiration and component respiration including soil, woody debris, stem and leaf respiration in old-growth hardwood-dominated and hemlock-dominated stands in northern Michigan, USA in 2002 and 2003. Respiration was mainly controlled by temperature, peaked in July-August and reached minimums in January-March. Total ecosystem respiration averaged 1013Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in the hardwood stand and 922Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in the hemlock stand. Cumulative annual soil respiration, coarse woody debris respiration, stem respiration, and leaf respiration were 724, 43, 131, 115Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1, respectively, accounting for 72%, 4%, 13%, and 11% of total ecosystem respiration in the hardwood stand, and 614, 29, 207, 72Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1, respectively, accounting for 67%, 3%, 22%, and 8% in the hemlock stand. Ecosystem respiration and its components except for leaf respiration in 2002 were larger than year 2003 due primarily to lower temperature in 2003. Component respiration except for stem respiration was higher in the hardwood stand than the hemlock stand. Daily mean ecosystem respiration upscaled from chamber measurements agreed well with eddy covariance measurements, with r2 of 0.96. By comparing respiration from the old-growth with a nearby young and a mature second-growth forest based on chamber measurements, we found that both age class and species are important in determining the magnitude and proportion of component respiration. Total ecosystem respiration generally increased from the young forest to the mature forest, and then decreased from the mature to the old-growth forest.",

The chronosequence consisted of (1) four recently disturbed stands, including a clearcut and repeatedly burned stand (burn), a blowdown and partial salvage stand (blowdown), a clearcut with sparse residual overstory (residual), and a regenerated stand from a complete clearcut (regenerated); (2) four young aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in average age of 10 years; (3) four intermediate aspen stands in average age of 26 years; (4) four mature northern hardwood stands in average age of 73 years; and (5) an old-growth stand approximately 350-years old. We fitted site-based models and used continuous measurements of soil temperature to estimate cumulative soil respiration for the growing season of 2005 (days 133-295). Cumulative soil respiration in the growing season was estimated to be 513, 680, 747, 747, 794, 802, 690, and 571 g C m-2 in the burn, blowdown, residual, regenerated, young, intermediate, mature, and old-growth stands, respectively. The measured apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was the highest in the regenerated stand, and declined from the young stands to the old-growth. Both, cumulative soil respiration and basal soil respiration at 10 Â°C, increased during stand establishment, peaked at intermediate age, and then decreased with age. Total soil carbon at 0-60 cm initially decreased after harvest, and increased after stands established. The old-growth stand accumulated carbon in deep layers of soils, but not in the surface soils. Our study suggests a complexity of long-term soil carbon dynamics, both in vertical depth and temporal scale. ",

The annual mean decomposition rate of litterfall increased followed the order of MTF (2.72) < TSF (3.15) < STF (3.50) (P < 0.05), which was not correlated with annual precipitation or annual mean temperature, but was rather related to litter quality. The nutrient use efficiency was found to be element-dependent and to vary significantly among the three forest types (P < 0.05). These results indicate that litterfall production and decomposition rates in different tropical forest systems are related to plant species composition and are influenced strongly by coexisting species and their life stage (age) but less so by the species richness. Constructing multi-species and multistory man-made tropical forest is an effective way to enhance biological productivity and maintain soil nutrients on degraded tropical land.",

Although the soils varied spatially over the site, their morphological, chemical and some physical properties were characteristic of spodosols. Two profiles representing the range of soils were analysed by horizon for: C, 14C and a number of chemical and physical properties. C in the fine litter and mineral soil, in the most representative soil at the site, was ca 3.0 and 15.8 kg m-2 respectively. About 0.65 kg CO2-C m-2 was respired annually from the forest floor, based on a simple exponential model relating CO2 efflux measured by a chamber technique, and soil temperature values. Temperature mainly controlled CO2 production by litter and soil because the site was well supplied with rainfall throughout the year. Annual transfers of C from the litter to the atmosphere and the soil, and mean residence times for C in the litter (ca 12 yr) and soils were estimated from the distribution of 14C using a â€˜bomb' radiocarbon model. A major source of soil C was root turnover, based on fine litterfall measurements and modelling of total C input. Root turnover and woody debris together represented 64% of the total C input of ca 0.8kg m-2yr-1 to the soil. Live root respiration, estimated experimentally and from a relationship between total root C allocation and litterfall, was ca 23% of the forest floor respiration. An imbalance of ca 0.35 kg C m-2 was observed in the annual soil C cycle, assuming steady-state conditions. Errors in estimating C fluxes from a combination of direct measurements and models, and underestimation of forest floor respiration, were probably responsible for this imbalance. Modelled mean residence times for soil C ranged from 76 to 207 yr, and resulted from widely different amounts of â€˜inert organic matter' being present in the upper 23 cm of the soils. A long history of tree overturn is the most likely cause of this concentration of recalcitrant C near the soil surface, and may explain the longer C storage time of soils developed under beech in New Zealand compared to those developed under native grassland.",

Emerging airborne remote sensing techniques offer a powerful approach to understand how aboveground carbon density (ACD) varies across tropical landscapes. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD across the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. LiDAR and field-estimated TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD surpassed 225 Mg C ha-1, indicating both that airborne CAO LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16% of the mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation in topographic slope explained an additional 18%. Lithologic and topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m than at 100-m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical landscapes.

The site represents a mid-latitude, 100-year-old, mixed deciduous and coniferous forest dominated by red maple, aspen and white pine. The years 1996 and 1997 were relatively cold, had a late spring and received below average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). This contrasts with an early spring, warmer soil and air temperatures during 1998-1999, and with distinctly wet year of 2000 and dry years of 2001-2003. The combination of early spring, warmer air and soil temperature and relatively high level of PPFD was associated with higher net ecosystem productivity (NEP) that peaked during 1999. Photosynthetic capacity was reduced and NEP showed a mid-growing season depression during the dry years of 2001-2003. Annual average ecosystem respiration (R) determined from a light response model was ~30% less than R derived from a logistic respiration equation, relating night time CO2 flux and soil temperature. However these independently determined R values were well correlated indicating that the site is unaffected by fetch and spatial heterogeneity problems. Based on the combined 8 years of growing season daytime data, an air temperature of 20-25Â Â°C and a vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of 1.3Â kPa were found to be the optimal conditions for CO2 uptake by the canopy. Over the 1996-2003 period, the forest sequestered carbon at an average rate of 140Â Â±Â 111Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1. The corresponding gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and R over this period were 1116Â Â±Â 93Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1 and 976Â Â±Â 68Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1, respectively. The annual carbon sequestration ranged from 19Â gCÂ m-2 in 1996 to 281Â gCÂ m-2 in 1999. However, these estimates were sensitive to frictional velocity threshold (u*TH) used for screening data associated with poor turbulent mixing at night. Increasing u*TH from 0.2Â mÂ s-1 (based on the inflection point in the nighttime CO2 flux vs. u* relationship) to 0.35Â mÂ s-1 (determined using a u*TH selection algorithm based on change-point detection) modified the 8-year mean NEP estimate from 140Â Â±Â 111Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1 to 65Â Â±Â 120Â gCÂ m-2Â y-1. Both approaches show that the Borden forest was a low to moderate sink of carbon over the 8-year period.",

The contribution of the different components of soil respiration flux (aboveground litter, belowground decomposition soil organic matter and root respiration) was estimated by a paired comparison of manipulative experiments between the recently coppiced stand (S1) and mature stand (S17). Ninety percent of soil respiration values were between 1.7 and 7.8 Âµmol m-2 s-1, with an overall mean (Â±SD) of 4.0Â±2.7 Âµmol m-2 s-1. Spatial variation of soil respiration was high (CV=44.9%), with a mean range (i.e. patch size) of 4.8Â±2.7 m, as estimated from a semivariance analysis. In the absence of limitation by soil moisture, soil respiration was related to soil temperature with the exponential Q10 model (average Q10=2.25). During summer, soil moisture constrained soil respiration and masked its dependence on soil temperature. Soil respiration declined over the years after coppicing. Assuming a linear decline with stand age, we estimated a reduction of 24% over a 20-year-rotation cycle. The response of soil respiration to temperature also changed with age of the stands: the Q10 was estimated to decrease from 2.90 in S1 to 2.42 in S17, suggesting that different components or processes may be involved at different developmental stages. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration flux was relatively larger in the young S1 stand than in the mature S17 stand. ",

In eight plots along an elevation gradient (1500-1900Â m), we measured soil temperature, forest floor and mineral soil C, litter decomposition, soil respiration, and forest floor mean residence time. Mean annual soil temperature and annual degree-days above 5Â Â°C were inversely correlated with elevation. Total soil C (166-241 MgÂ·ha-1) showed no trend with elevation, while forest floor C accumulation (16.3-35.9 MgÂ·ha-1) decreased significantly with elevation. Carbon dynamics did not follow a consistent elevation pattern; however, the cooler upper elevations showed the lowest C turnover as indicated by the lowest needle decomposition rate (k = 0.0231Â·year-1) and the longest mean residence time of forest floor C (22Â years). Mean annual CO2 efflux from the soil (1020-1830Â kg CÂ·ha-1Â·year-1) was negatively correlated with mean annual soil temperatures and annual degree-days above 5 Â°C. This gradient study offers useful insights into C release patterns under future warming scenarios, and suggests that the highest elevation may be most susceptible to global warming.",

In this regard, it is important to know the part of total efflux that originates from root respiration. We have tried to evaluate it by measuring efflux in the field with a portable infrared gas analyzer, while at the same time, the 0-10 cm soil layer was sampled and incubated in the laboratory during 30-40 days. Comparison of field and laboratory measurements was made by conversion to a common temperature (10 Â°C) using the Arrhenius equation for both processes. Results indicated an Arrhenius apparent activation energy of 25 kcal (1 kcal = 4.1855 kJ) in the field and 15 kcal in the laboratory. Comparison of the results was also made possible by modelling the cumulative CO2 efflux in the laboratory so that we eliminated the initial flush of mineralization, the value of which was temperature dependent. The grand average of CO2 efflux from the forest soil calculated for the whole year from the temperature of the soil and the Arrhenius equation was 70 Mgâ€¢ha-1â€¢year-1, of which 90% originated from the roots.",

We sought to evaluate the extent that gross primary productivity, net ecosystem exchange, ecosystem respiration, net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, tree transpiration, and evapotranspiration varied seasonally and interannually in this ecosystem subjected to varying periods and severity of droughts. To explain variation, we found it necessary to define seasons functionally within a hydroecological year rather than by fixed calendar dates. The interannual variability in growing season length was large (45 days), and the end date was more variable than the onset. Plant-available soil water was the main determinant of carbon fluxes. Spring evapotranspiration primarily used shallow water, whereas summer and fall evapotranspiration drew water from deeper in the soil profile. A multiyear drought (2001-2003) had a more severe and fundamentally different impact on carbon and water cycles than a single-year (2005) drought because of carryover effects in soil water and carbohydrate reserves in plant tissue. Calendar year-based analysis was inadequate to diagnose drought years in precipitation and ecosystem drought response. Extension of meteorological records back to 1982 showed that anomalies were coherent across the region and that the observations represented below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures coherent with a warm-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The carbon sink of this seasonally water-limited ecosystem is anticipated to increase with increasing available soil water during the growing season. ",

Cultivation of forest lands leads to substantial losses in both biomass and soil carbon, whereas forest regrowth is considered to be a significant carbon sink. We examined below- and aboveground carbon stocks along a chronosequence of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands (0-62 years old) regenerating on abandoned meadows in the Southern Alps. A 130-year-old mixed coniferous Norway spruce-white fir (Abies alba Mill.) forest, managed by selection cutting, was used as an undisturbed control. Deforestation about 260 years ago led to carbon losses of 53 Mg C ha-1 from the organic layer and 12 Mg C ha-1 from the upper mineral horizons (Ah, E). During the next 200 years of grassland use, the new Ah horizon sequestered 29 Mg C ha-1. After the abandonment of these meadows, carbon stocks in tree stems increased exponentially during natural forest succession, levelling off at about 190 Mg C ha-1 in the 62-year-old Norway spruce and the 130-year-old Norway spruce-white fir stands. In contrast, carbon stocks in the organic soil layer increased linearly with stand age. During the first 62 years, carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.36 Mg C ha-1 year-1 in the organic soil layer. No clear trend with stand age was observed for the carbon stocks in the Ah horizon. Soil respiration rates were similar for all forest stands independently of organic layer thickness or carbon stocks, but the highest rates were observed in the cultivated meadow. Thus, increasing litter inputs by forest vegetation compared with the meadow, and constantly low decomposition rates of coniferous litter were probably responsible for continuous soil carbon sequestration during forest succession. Carbon accumulation in woody biomass seemed to slow down after 60 to 80 years, but continued in the organic soil layer. We conclude that, under present climatic conditions, forest soils act as more persistent carbon sinks than vegetation that will be harvested, releasing the carbon sequestered during tree growth.",

Hook) plantations in Huitong Ecosystem Research Station, Hunan, China. Soil temperature and moisture were also measured to examine relationships between FCO2 and soil properties. Forest thinning resulted in huge changes in FCO2 that varied with time since cutting. Immediately following harvest (year 0) FCO2 in thinning area increased by about 30%, declined to 20%-27% below pre-cutting levels during years 4-6, and recovered to pre-cutting levels at 8 years post-cutting. A similar temporal pattern, but with smaller changes, was found in non-thinning locations. The initial increase in FCO2 could be attributed to a combination of root decay, soil disturbance, and increased soil temperature in gaps, while the subsequent decrease and recovery to the death and gradual regrowth of active roots. Strong effects of soil temperature and soil water content on FCO2 were found. Forest thinning mainly influenced FCO2 through changes in tree root respiration, and the net result was a decrease in integrated FCO2 flux through the entire felling cycle.",

The diurnal and seasonal dynamics of soil respiration (R s) in Cinnamomum camphora and Liquidambar formosana forests were investigated by using infrared gas exchange analyzer of Li-Cor 6400-09 each month in 2006. Soil temperature and moisture were also measured. Diurnal variations in R s varied with daily soil temperature in the two forests. Across the growing season, soil respiration peaked on July 28 due to higher soil temperature and moisture conditions. Seasonal R s variations were predominantly influenced by soil temperature. Seasonal soil respirations in C. camphora and L. formosana forests were strongly related to soil temperature (x) at 5-cm depth (R s = 0.1598e0.1377x (R 2 = 0.9289, P = 0.001) and R s = 0.2177e0.0962x (R 2 = 0.927, P = 0.000)), while annual mean R s rate was 2.614 and 1.397 Âµmol m-2 s-1 and Q 10 values was 3.96 and 2.62 for the two forests, respectively.

A positive relationship between R s and soil moisture were observed when soil moisture was below 12.43% and 18.00%, but when soil moisture exceeded threshold values of 12.43% and 18.00%, soil moisture became the restraint factor for R s. Long-term observations of soil respiration and moisture are required to understand the temporal dynamics of soil respiration.",

Belowground allocation of C in these deep-rooting forests is very large (1900 g C m-2 yr-1) relative to litterfall (460 g C m-2 yr-1). The presence of live roots drives an active carbon cycle deeper than l m in the soil. Although bulk C concentrations and 14C contents of soil organic matter at >l-m depths are low, estimates of turnover from fine-root inputs, CO2 production, and the 14C content of CO2 produced at depth show that up to 15% of the carbon inventory in the deep soil has turnover times of decades or less. Thus the amount of fast-cycling soil carbon between 1 and 8-m depths (2-3 kg C m-2, out of 17-18 kg C m-2) is significant compared to the amount present in the upper meter of soil (3-4 kg C m-2 out of 10-11 kg C m-2). A model of belowground carbon cycling derived from measurements of carbon stocks and fluxes, and constrained using carbon isotopes, is used to predict C fluxes associated with conversion of deep-rooting forests to pasture and subsequent pasture management. The relative proportions and turnover times of active (including detrital plant material; 1-3 year turnover), slow (decadal and shorter turnover), and passive (centennial to millennial turnover) soil organic matter pools are determined by depth for the forest soil, using constraints from measurements of C stocks, fluxes, and isotopic content. Reduced carbon inputs to the soil in degraded pastures, which are less productive than the forests they replace, lead to a reduction in soil carbon inventory and <U+0394>14C, in accord with observations. Managed pastures, which have been fertilized with phosphorous and planted with more productive grasses, show increases in C and 14C over forest values. Carbon inventory increases in the upper meter of managed pasture soils are partially offset by predicted carbon losses due to death and decomposition of fine forest roots at depths >1 m in the soil. The major adjustments in soil carbon inventory in response to land management changes occur within the first decade after conversion. Carbon isotopes are shown to be more sensitive indicators of recent accumulation or loss of soil organic matter than direct measurement of soil C inventories. ",

Estimates of the mean residence time of C in forest fine roots (inventory divided by loss rate) are substantially shorter (1-3 years) than the age of standing fine root C stocks obtained from radiocarbon (4-11 years). By assuming positively skewed distributions for root ages, we can effectively decouple the mean age of C in live fine roots (measured using 14C) from the rate of C flow through the live root pool, and resolve these apparently disparate estimates of root C dynamics. Explaining the 14C values in soil pore space CO2, in addition, requires that a portion of the decomposing roots be cycled through soil organic matter pools with decadal turnover time. ",

Four levels of N treatments: control (no N added), low-N (50Â kgÂ N ha-1Â year-1), medium-N (150Â kgÂ N ha-1Â year-1), and high-N (300Â kgÂ N ha-1Â year-1) were set in the present study. The results showed that soil respiration followed a clear seasonal pattern, with the maximum rates in mid-summer and the minimum in late winter. The annual cumulative soil respiration was 585 Â± 43Â g CO2-CÂ m-2Â year-1 in the control plots. Simulated N deposition significantly increased the mean annual soil respiration rate, fine root biomass, soil microbial biomass C (MBC), and N concentration in fine roots and fresh leaf litter. Soil respirations exhibited a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, and a linear relationship with MBC. The net primary production (NPP) ranged from 10.95 to 15.01Â MgÂ C ha-1Â year-1 and was higher than the annual soil respiration (5.85 to 7.62Â MgÂ C ha-1Â year-1) in all treatments. Simulated N deposition increased the net ecosystem production (NEP), and there was a significant difference between the control and high N treatment NEP, whereas, the difference of NEP among control, low-N, and medium-N was not significant. Results suggest that N controlled the primary production in this bamboo plantation ecosystem. Simulated N deposition increased the C sequestration of the P. amarus plantation ecosystem through increasing the plant C pool, though CO2 emission through soil respiration was also enhanced.",

RSR was stimulated by N additions through increasing fine root biomass and root metabolic rate. The positive effects of N additions on soil fertility, microbial activity, and the quality and amount of aboveground litterfall also stimulated other CO2 production processes. In the background of increased N input, response of RST and components of RST areÂ primarily due to the positive response of plant growth in this bamboo ecosystem.",

The 450 m long ecotone extended from xeric, upland pine dominated habitats, through spruce and transitional spruce-pine-birch forest, to sedge peatlands downslope. The CO2 fluxes were measured at nine stations during 2005 using chamber and IR techniques. Instantaneous P and R measurements for each station were interpolated by fitting their response to continuous records of light (mean R2 = 0.66) and temperature (mean R2 = 0.77) recorded nearby to give annual estimates. Stand biomass increment was used to estimate the annual CO2 exchange contribution of the trees. Annual P values from -307 to -1632 gCO2m-2yr-1 were inversely correlated with FF light (r = -0.96), FF above-ground biomass (r=-0.92) and canopy openness (r=-0.95). Annual R values from 1263 to 2813 gCO2 m-2 yr-1 were correlated with tree stand foliar biomass (r = 0.77). Estimated NEE values varied from 546 to -1679 gCO2m-2/yr-1, with P contributing from -307 to -1632 gCO2m-2yr-1 (4-90%) to gross ecosystem photosynthetic production, and R from 1263 to 2813 gCO2m-2yr-1 (70-98%) to gross ecosystem respiration (GR).",

Soil nutrient capital and nutrient removals in forest harvesting were estimated together with potential impacts of these removals on the nutrient capital balance. Soils were anlysed from eighty sites for phosphorus fractions, including organic phosphorus fractions, and total and exchangeable cations. Based on typical forest harvesting systems, it was found that 3-4 kg phosphorus would be removed per hectare. Due to equilibrium between the various soil phosphorus components, depletion would not be solely from the more available pools. It is expected that at least four forest rotations (320 years) would be required before any detectable change would occur, within forest communities. A similar depletion estimate was calculated for the potentially most vulnerable cation, calcium. The other nutrient cations, magnesium and potassium had considerably greater reserves.",

Permanent measurement plots were established immediately after a light fire which removed litter and understorey but was not intense enough to cause damage to trees. Fires of various intensities is a common occurrence in these forest types. Plots were re-measured 5 years later to allow estimates of productivity to be made. Biomass of trees and large shrubs was calculated using equations developed for each species; lesser vegetation was estimated using destructive sampling. Average biomass for the catchment was estimated after stratifying the catchment based on topography. Mean weighted average of tree aboveground biomass at the first measurement was 272 t ha-1, and accumulation was -1.0 t ha-1 year-1. The understorey biomass was 28 t ha-1 with a productivity of 10.8 t ha-1 year-1. The total aboveground productivity was estimated as 14.4 t ha-1 year-1 of which 75% was in understorey.

The speed and vigor of forest regeneration following disturbance of this type provide a measure of the recuperative potential of this ecosystem. The study plot (0.09 ha) was dominated by forbs during the 1st yr and then by the pioneer tree species Cecropia ficifolia Snethlage during year two. Tree mortality exceeded establishment during the 3rd yr because of C. ficifolia trees died nearly in unison. During the 4th yr, tree density increased sharply as successional and forest tree species grew in the space vacated by C. ficifolia. The canopy was dominated at that time by the pioneer species Vismia japurensis Reich. and Vismia lauriformis (Lam.) Choisy. By the 5th yr, all establishment space had apparently been preempted: there were only 0.07 new establishments/m2 during year five, while 95% of the trees present at the end of year four survived through the 5th yr. There were 56 tree species (@<2 m tall) present on the site after 5 yr. More than half of these were primary forest species. Primary forest species were most common in the understory. These trees averaged >1 m in growth height each year and should eventually grow into the canopy. Hence, it appears that most individuals that will participate in the aggrading phase of forest development were already present on the site within 5 yr of burning. Biomass was only 66 g/m2 at the end of the 1st yr, but Â°1000 g/m2 were added in each subsequent year. The standing crop of biomass (shoot and root) at 5 yr was 4840 g/m2, a value 16% that of the mature forest which occupied the site prior to cutting. Approximately 27% of the dead trunk and branch biomass from the pre-existing forest remained on the site after 5 yr. Litter production increased each year from 39 g/m2 (year one) to 825 g/m2 (year five) and tended to be inversely related to rainfall. Total aboveground production was highest for the 5th yr (1940 g/m2) and was probably close to a maximum for the site. Total live-plant nutrient stocks after 5 yr, as a percentage of the precut forest stocks, were 15% for N, 23% for P, 39% for K, 48% for Ca, and 45% for Mg. A large increase in the leachate concentrations of K, Mg, and NO3 occurred during the first 2 yr following burning. By the 5th yr, concentrations were not significantly different from those in the undisturbed forest. After 5 yr soil nutrient levels were also similar to those of the preburn forest. Overall, nutrient losses apparently were not great enough to destroy the site's ability to return eventually to a state similar to that which existed prior to disturbance. This does not mean that a more severe treatment, such as conversion of forest to pasture, would not affect the regrowth ability of a site. ",

We also estimated the potential tree mortality that might result from a wide-scale Amazon forest fire by measuring the thermal properties of bark for all trees in a 5-ha stand of mature forest, followed by measurements of heat flux through bark during simulated fires. Partial logging resulted in dramatic increases in downed woody debris. Total fuel mass was significantly greater in the logged forest (180 Mg/ha) compared to the other cover types (30-60 Mg/ha). However, the readily combustible fine-fuels (e.g., grasses, litter, herbs) were significantly greater in pastures (Â° 11 Mg/ha) than in all other cover types (Â° 6 Mg/ha). Anthropogenic disturbance altered microclimate, which in turn affected rates of fuel moisture loss and the dynamic equilibrium of fuel moisture contents. In pastures of average midday temperature was almost 10oC greater, and the average midday relative humidity was 30% lower, than in primary forest. There was a sixfold difference in average vapor pressure deficit between the primary-forest and the open-pasture cover types. Given the relatively steep gradient between the vapor pressure of the fuel particles and the surrounding atmosphere in the disturbed communities, fuel moisture loss was more rapid and equilibrium moisture contents were lower than in primary forest. Based on the changes in fuels and microclimate, we determined that cattle pastures were the most fire-prone ecosystem. During much of the 6-mo ""dry"" season (total rainfall: 200-400 mm), sustained combustion was possible in this community within 24 h following rainfall events. Openings in the selectively logged forest would burn after 5-6 rainless days and in the second-growth forest after 8-10 d. In contrast, sustained combustion was not possible in the primary forest even after prolonged rainless periods (e.g., >30 d). Through an examination of bark tissues and simulated fires in primary forest we found that only a small percentage of the standing vegetation would likely survive even a low-intensity, surface fire. Mean (@+ SE) bark thickness for trees > 20 cm in diameter was 7.3 @+ 0.14 mm (n = 699) with values ranging from 1.5 to 28.9 mm. We found a significant relationship (r2 = 0.77) between bark thickness and maximum cambium temperatures during fire simulations, and thereby estimated that in the event of a surface fire in the primary forest, 98% of all stems Â° 1 cm diameter at breast height would be killed. Even though the autogenic factors in primary forest of the eastern Amazon create a microclimate that virtually eliminates the probability of fire, they are currently a common event in disturbed areas of Amazonia. As many as 8 x 106 ha burned in the Amazon Basin of Brazil in 1987 alone. In terms of current land-use patterns, altered microclimates, and fuel mass, there are also striking similarities between the eastern Amazon and East Kalimantan, Indonesia (the site of recent rain forest wildfires that burned 3.5 x 106 ha).

Annual net uptake of CO2 ranged from 1.0 to 4.7 Mg-C ha-1yr-1, with an average of 2.5 Mg-C ha-1yr-1. Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75-110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5-31.5 Âµmole m-2s-1), woody biomass (101-115 Mg-C ha-1 from 1993-2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5-5.5 from 1998-2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend. The drivers of interannual and decadal changes in NEE are long-term increases in tree biomass, successional change in forest composition, and disturbance events, processes not well represented in current models.

In the present study the stand chronosequence approach was applied to analyse C sequestration dynamics. Study was made of C accumulation both in biomass and in the soil in 6-60-year-old silver birch (Betula pendula) stands growing at fertile (Oxalis) sites.As the growth of the studied stands was vigorous, their yield was higher than that presented in several yield tables for earlier periods. The C concentration (C%) in different compartments of the trees varied between 47% and 55%. However, the weighted average of C concentration in the silver birch trees was approximately 50% regardless of stand age. The average C concentration of the herbaceous understorey plants was 43.3Â Â±Â 0.5%.The soil Corg pool was independent of stand age, and so far there occurred no C accumulation during stand succession, expressed as Corg values or stage of forest floor formation. This might indicate fast Corg turnover in the soils of the Oxalis site. The total C pool in a mature silver birch stand was 185Â tÂ ha-1 of which 50% was accumulated in the aboveground part of the trees. In young birch stands the C pool in aboveground biomass and in the soil accounted for 21-39% and 53-71%, respectively, of the total C pool of a stand. In pre-mature and mature stands the corresponding share accounted for 50-59% of the aboveground C of the trees and 29-38% of the soil C pool. Due to closed canopies, the role of herbaceous understorey plants as a C sink was modest, constituting 1% or even less of the total C pool of the older stands. The annual C flux 1.6Â tÂ ha-1Â yr-1 into the soil via litter fall was the largest in the middle-age stand.Our results show that the main C sink in fertile silver birch stands is located in the wooden parts of trees. The C pool in tree biomass increased with stand age, whereas the soil Corg pool remained stable. For a more profound understanding of C cycling in silver birch forest, soil respiration fluxes should be measured.",

Soil respiration was measured over 2 successive years in Holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota; Qi); Pyrenean Oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd; Qp); and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.; Ps) forest stands located in the area surrounding Madrid (Spain), to assess the long term effects of wildfires on C efflux from the soil, soil properties, and the role of soil temperature and soil moisture in the variation of soil respiration.MethodsSoil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, fine root mass, microbial biomass, biological and chemical soil parameters were compared between non burned (NB) and burned sites (B).ResultsThe annual C losses through soil respiration from NB sites in Qi, Qp and Ps were 790, 1010, 1380 gCm-2 yr-1, respectively, with the B sites emitting 43Â %, 22Â % and 11Â % less in Qi, Qp and Ps respectively. Soil microclimate changed with higher soil temperature and lower soil moisture in B sites after fire. Exchangeable cations and the pH also decreased. The total SOC stocks were not significantly altered, but 6-8Â years after wildfires, there was still measurably lower fine root and microbial biomass, while SOC quality changed, indicated by lower the C/N ratio and the labile carbon and a relative increase in refractory SOC forms, which resulted in lower Q10 values.ConclusionsWe found long term effects of wildfires on the physical, chemical and biological soil characteristics, which in turn affected soil respiration. The response of soil respiration to temperature was controlled by moisture and changed with ecosystem type, season, and between B and NB sites. Lower post-burn Q10 integrated the loss of roots and microbial biomass, change in SOC quality and a decrease in soil moisture.",

Appropriate implementation of silvopastoral practices in dehesa systems may contribute to their sustainability; improve soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage capacity while reducing the carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from the soil to the atmosphere. The response of soil respiration (Rs) to grazing and tilling practices and trees canopy influence were studied in a dehesa ecosystem in the center of Spain from July 2008 to February 2010. Four different treatments were established: non grazed-non tilled; non grazed-tilled; grazed-non tilled and grazed and tilled. In all the treatments Rs, soil temperature (Ts), soil moisture (Ms), soil C and N stocks were measured. Grazing reduced Rs by 12Â % across all experiment. Increments of 3Â Mg/ha in C stocks and 0.3Â Mg/ha in N stocks in grazing soils were observed. Although, no clear tilling effect on Rs was found, a decrease of 3.5Â Mg/ha in soil C stocks and 0.3Â Mg/ha in N stocks was detected in tilled soils. Presence of tree canopy induced increases in Rs, soil C and N stocks; while decreases in Ts were observed, but grazing decreased the tree canopy influence on annual C losses by Rs. The Ms constrained the temperature response of Rs during the experiment, and meaningful Q10 values were only obtainable during the wettest time, ranging from 2.5 to 5.7. Grazing and tree canopy had a positive influence in the ability of soils to store soil C and N, while tilling had a negative effect on soil C and N store capacity in this study. Maintaining the beneficial practices and improving tillage management in this area may have important consequences in carbon sequestration capacity in this dehesa system.",

Responses of soil respiration to temperature fluctuations were investigated in a root-free soil of a mid-European beech-oak forest. First, in laboratory we analysed the efflux of CO2 from soil microcosms exposed to seasonal (Â±5Â Â°C of the annual mean) and diurnal fluctuations (Â±5Â Â°C of the seasonal levels) in a two-factorial design. Second, in field microcosms we investigated effects of smoothing diurnal temperature fluctuations in soil (simulating a possible global trend) on CO2 efflux. Third, the natural temperature regime was simulated in laboratory microcosms and their CO2 efflux was compared to the one in the field. The experiments lasted for 1 year to differentiate seasonal and annual responses.Dynamics of CO2 efflux, microbial basal respiration, biomass and qO2 varied with seasonal temperature regime. However, in the laboratory the annual cumulative CO2-C production did not differ between treatments and varied between 10.9% and 11.7% of the total microcosm C, disregarding seasonal and/or diurnal fluctuations. The similarity of cumulative C production suggests that the availability of microbially mobilisable carbon pools rather than the temperature regime limited soil respiration. Diurnal fluctuations generally did not affect CO2 efflux and microbial activity, though winter Q10 values were increased in their absence. Simulation of the natural temperature regime in the laboratory resulted in CO2 efflux similar to field microcosms. In the field, rates of CO2 efflux and microbial activity, seasonal and annual cumulative CO2-C production were significantly higher at smoothed than at natural temperature conditions (annually 13.1% and 11.0% of total C was respired, respectively). Facing global climate changes the mechanisms regulating responses of soil respiration to temperature fluctuations need further investigation.",

Total fine detritus production ranged from 0.69 to 1.21Â kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 with significant differences among species but with no correlation between litterfall and fine-root growth. Soil CO2 emissions ranged from 1.61 to 2.36Â kg CÂ·m-2Â·year-1 with no significant differences among species. Soil respiration increased with fine-root production but not with litterfall, suggesting that soil C emissions may depend more on belowground inputs or that both fine root production and soil respiration are similarly influenced by an external factor. Estimates of rootÂ + rhizosphere respiration comprised 52% of total soil respiration on average, and there was no evidence that rhizosphere respiration was associated with fine-root growth rates among species. These results suggest that inherent differences in fine-root production among species, rather than differences in aboveground litterfall, might play a main role explaining local-scale, among-forest variations in soil C emissions.",

A common method to quantify carbon stocks in forests is the use of allometric regression models to convert forest inventory data to estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). The use of allometric models implies decisions on the selection of extant models or the development of a local model, the predictor variables included in the selected model, and the number of trees and species for destructive biomass measurements. We assess uncertainties associated with these decisions using data from 94 secondary forest plots in central Panama and 244 harvested trees belonging to 26 locally abundant species. AGB estimates from species-specific models were used to assess relative errors of estimates from multispecies models. To reduce uncertainty in the estimation of plot AGB, including wood specific gravity (WSG) in the model was more important than the number of trees used for model fitting. However, decreasing the number of trees increased uncertainty of landscape-level AGB estimates substantially, while including WSG had limited effects on the accuracy of the landscape-level estimates. Predictions of stand and landscape AGB varied strongly among models, making model choice an important source of uncertainty. Local models provided more accurate AGB estimates than foreign models, but high variability in carbon stocks across the landscape implies that developing local models is only justified when landscape sampling is sufficiently intensive.",

Overstory C pools and net C sequestration in live trees was estimated from periodic inventories between 1993 and 2003. The CO2 release from standing and downed wood was based on biomass and C concentration estimates and published decomposition constants by decay class and species.

In order to study the vulnerability of cacao (Theobroma cacao) - Gliricidia sepium agroforestry plantations to droughts a large scale throughfall displacement roof was built in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In this 19-month experiment, we compared soil surface CO2 efflux (soil respiration) from three roof plots with three adjacent control plots. Soil respiration rates peaked at intermediate soil moisture conditions and decreased under increasingly dry conditions (drought induced), or increasingly wet conditions (as evidenced in control plots). The roof plots exhibited a slight decrease in soil respiration compared to the control plots (average 13% decrease). The strength of the drought effect was spatially variable - while some measurement chamber sites reacted strongly (responsive) to the decrease in soil water content (up to R2=0.70) (n=11), others did not react at all (non-responsive) (n=7). A significant correlation was measured between responsive soil respiration chamber sites and sap flux density ratios of cacao (R=0.61) and Gliricidia (R=0.65). Leaf litter CO2 respiration decreased as conditions became drier. The litter layer contributed approximately 3-4% of the total CO2 efflux during dry periods and up to 40% during wet periods. Within days of roof opening soil CO2 efflux rose to control plot levels. Thereafter, CO2 efflux remained comparable between roof and control plots. The cumulative effect on soil CO2 emissions over the duration of the experiment was not significantly different: the control plots respired 11.1Â±0.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, while roof plots respired 10.5Â±0.5 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. The relatively mild decrease measured in soil CO2 efflux indicates that this agroforestry ecosystem is capable of mitigating droughts with only minor stress symptoms. ",

This study is the first attempt to continuously measure soil CO2 concentrations in a seasonally dry tropical forest to describe diel patterns of soil CO2 and respiration. Here we used solid-state CO2 sensors and the gradient flux method to calculate soil respiration following the unexpected pass of hurricane Wilma at the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Mean annual soil respiration for the year following the hurricane was 10.4 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1 with a cumulative soil respiration of 3821 g CO2 m-2 a-1. Soil CO2 concentrations returned to prehurricane levels after 6 months at 16 cm depth, however, soil CO2 remained higher at 2 and 16 cm depth 1 year after the event. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed that soil respiration was 18% higher 1 year after the hurricane than during the same dates before the event. Diel patterns of soil respiration were decoupled from soil temperature with higher values at night between 2400 and 0600 h. Between 67 and 70% of total soil respiration was produced in the 2-8 cm layer, and this contribution was relatively constant across the sampled year and before the hurricane. We found seasonal shifts in the amplitude and shape and of diel hysteresis effects of soil respiration suggesting that other biophysical mechanisms regulate daily patterns of soil respiration other than soil temperature alone in this tropical forest.

The diel hysteresis at Wv was explained by including the temperature-dependent component of soil respiration and the variation dependent on photosynthetically active radiation. â€¢ The results show that vegetation type and fine root and rhizomorph dynamics influence soil respiration in addition to changes in light, temperature and moisture.

Technological advances of automated biometeorological measurements provide the opportunity to apply spectral methods on continuous time series to identify differences in amplitudes and phases and relationships with weather variation. Here we used wavelet coherence analysis to study the temporal covariance between soil CO2 production and soil temperature, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Continuous (hourly average) data were acquired over 2 years among three vegetation types in a semiarid mixed temperate forest. We showed that soil temperature and soil moisture influence soil CO2 production differently at multiple periods (e.g. hours, days, weeks, months, years), especially after rain pulse events. Our results provide information about the periodicity of soil CO2 production among vegetation types, and provide insights about processes controlling CO2 production through the study of phase relationships between two time series (e.g. soil CO2 production and PAR). We tested the performance of empirical models of soil CO2 production using the continuous wavelet transform. These models, built around soil temperature and moisture, failed at multiple periods across the measured dates, suggesting that empirical models should include other factors that regulate soil CO2 production at different temporal scales. Our results add a new dimension for the analysis of continuous time series of biometeorological measurements and model testing, which will prove useful for analysis of increasing sensor data obtained by environmental networks.

Production of fine litter (leaves, twigs <2 cm in diameter, flowers, and fruits) was measured over a 3-yr period. Litter traps were installed in plots located near (<100 m) and far (>250 m) from forest edges, and in clayey or sandy soils. In total, 28 plots were established, with 10 litter traps per plot. Results reveal a significant effect of distance to forest edge on litter production, but no significant effect of soil type or interaction between soil type and edge distance. On average, annual litter production on edge plots exceeded that on the interior plots by 0.68 Mg/ha (9.50 Â± 0.23 vs. 8.82 Â± 0.14 MgÂ·ha-1Â·yr-1, mean Â± 1 se, based on a 3-yr period). With regard to nutrient concentrations in the leaf fall, we detected a significant effect of soil type on three of eight nutrients analyzed. Concentrations of N, Mg, and Mn were greater in leaves on clayey than on sandy soils. Distance to forest edge only significantly affected the concentration of Ca, which was greater near than far from edges, perhaps due to strong Ca mobilization by the roots of pioneer trees. Several factors may account for the observed increase in litterfall near forest edges, including the greater prevalence of winds, increased plant desiccation stress, and higher rates of tree recruitment, especially of pioneer trees, near edges. Elevated rates of litterfall are likely to have cascading effects on the ecology of fragmented forests, affecting the invertebrate fauna, increasing seed and seedling mortality, and causing forest fragments to be more vulnerable to destructive surface fires.

The primary objective of this study was to quantify the effects of moisture and substrate availability on soil trace gas fluxes in an Amazonian regrowth forest. We measured the efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) from soil in response to two experimental manipulations. In the first, we increased soil moisture availability during the dry season by irrigation; in the second, we decreased substrate availability by continuous removal of aboveground litter. In the absence of irrigation, soil CO2 efflux decreased during the dry season while irrigation maintained soil CO2 efflux levels similar to the wet season. Large variations in soil CO2 efflux consistent with a significant moisture constraint on respiration were observed in response to soil wet-up and dry-down events. Annual soil C efflux for irrigated plots was 27 and 13% higher than for control plots in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Litter removal significantly reduced soil CO2 efflux; annual soil C efflux in 2002 was 28% lower for litter removal plots compared to control plots. The annual soil C efflux:litterfall C ratio for the control treatment (4.0-5.2) was consistent with previously reported values for regrowth forests that indicate a relatively large belowground C allocation. In general, fluxes of N2O and CH4 were higher during the wet season and both fluxes increased during dry-season irrigation. There was no seasonal effect on NO fluxes. Litter removal had no significant impact on N oxide or CH4 emissions. Net soil nitrification did not respond to dry-season irrigation, but was somewhat reduced by litter removal. Overall, these results demonstrate significant soil moisture and substrate constraints on soil trace gas emissions, particularly for CO2, and suggest that climate and land-use changes that alter moisture and substrate availability are therefore likely to have an impact on atmosphere chemistry.

The open woodland studied consisted of an overstorey dominated by Colophospermum mopane with a sparse understorey of grasses and herbs. Measurements presented here cover a 19-month period from the end of the rainy season in March 1999 to the end of the dry season September 2000. During the wet season, sensible and latent heat fluxes showed a linear dependence on incoming solar radiation (I) with a Bowen ratio (iŸ) typically just below unity. Although iŸ was typically around 1 at low incoming solar radiation (150 W m-2) during the dry season, it increased dramatically with I, typically being as high as 4 or 5 around solar noon. Thus, under these water-limited conditions, almost all available energy was dissipated as sensible, rather than latent heat. Marked spikes of CO2 release occurred at the onset of the rainfall season after isolated rainfall events and respiration dominated the balance well into the rainfall season. During this time, the ecosystem was a constant source of CO2 with an average flux of 3-5 Âµmol m-2 s-1 to the atmosphere during both day and night. But later in the wet season, for example, in March 2000 under optimal soil moisture conditions, with maximum leaf canopy development (leaf area index 0.9-1.3), the peak ecosystem CO2 influx was as much as 10 Âµmol m-2 s-1. The net ecosystem maximum photosynthesis at this time was estimated at 14 Âµmol m-2 s-1, with the woodland ecosystem a significant sink for CO2. During the dry season, just before leaf fall in August, maximum day- and night-time net ecosystem fluxes were typically -3 Âµmol m-2 s-1 and 1-2 Âµmol m-2 s-1, respectively, with the ecosystem still being a marginal sink. Over the course of 12 months (March 1999-March 2000), the woodland was more or less carbon neutral, with a net uptake estimated at only about 1 mol C m-2 yr-1. The annual net photosynthesis (gross primary production) was estimated at 32.2 mol m-2 yr-1. ",

The annual course of the CO2 flux density clearly showed the influence of temperature and incoming radiation on stand assimilation. Monthly mean fluxes were directed towards the stand throughout the year and ranged from 40 kg CO2 ha-1 day-1 in winter to 220 kg CO2 ha-1 day-1 in summer.Results for 1989 were compared with CO2 uptake by the stand, as estimated by a forest growth model, after correction for the soil respiration flux calculated by the model. For the summer months the simulated CO2 uptake agreed with the measurements within the range of uncertainty. During winter-time, however, the model predicted a net loss of CO2 to the atmosphere, whereas the measurements still indicated uptake of CO2 by the ecosystem, in spite of the lower temperature and radiation levels. The difference in the winter months may partially be explained by the uncertainty in the annual course of the soil respiration flux estimated by the model. More probably, however, advection from adjacent deciduous stands and the use of the gradient method beyond its theoretical restraints, may have led to large systematic errors in the fluxes during winter-time.",

The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify the effect of contrasting methods of organic residue management on tree growth and soil CO2 effluxes in the first 2Â years after planting and (2) to evaluate the impact of organic residue manipulations on the mineralization of soil organic matter over the length of the experiment. Three treatments were setup in 0.125Â ha plots and replicated in three blocks at the harvesting of a Congolese Eucalyptus stand, resulting in an aboveground organic residue mass ranging from 0 to 6.3Â kgÂ m-2. The mineralization of SOM was deduced in each treatment by partitioning sources of soil CO2 effluxes using decomposition experiments and by upscaling specific root respiration. Soil CO2 effluxes were greatly affected by seasons and organic residue manipulation, although there were no significant changes in topsoil water content and topsoil temperature over most of the study period. Aboveground organic residue was the first contributor to soil CO2 efflux in the two treatments with a litter layer. Organic residue management did not significantly influence the mineralization of SOM in our study, probably due to the low quality of Eucalyptus litter, or to the hypothetical lack of dissolved organic carbon transfers from litter to soil. A strong relationship was found between cumulative heterotrophic CO2 efflux and tree growth, supporting the hypothesis that the early growth of Eucalyptus trees in a sandy tropical soil is largely dependent on the nutrients released by the decomposition of organic residues.",

We assessed soil respiration, and rates of C turnover in six tree species in a more than 30-year-old common garden experiment replicated at six sites in Denmark. The studied tree species were the broadleaves beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), lime (Tilia cordata L.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and the conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Rates of C turnover were estimated by (i) the ratio of estimated soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) to C stock in forest floor and top mineral soil, (ii) the ratio of litterfall C to forest floor C, (iii) foliar mass loss in litterbags, and (iv) mineral soil C turnover assessed by laboratory incubation. Soil respiration differed significantly among several species and increased in the order beechÂ <Â limeÂ <Â spruceÂ =Â oakÂ =Â mapleÂ <Â ash. Soil respiration was temperature limited with no significant species difference in Q10. Norway spruce soils were significantly driest, and soil respiration was also limited by soil moisture. Carbon turnover rates based on the ratio between Rh and C stock were significantly higher in ash than in all other species except maple, and maple also had higher C turnover than spruce. A similar influence of tree species on C turnover was indicated by the litterfall C to forest floor C ratio and by foliar mass loss; rates of C turnover increased in the order spruceÂ <Â beechÂ <Â oakÂ <Â ashÂ =Â limeÂ =Â maple with significant differences between several of the species. Mineral soil C turnover during laboratory incubation was highest for ash, maple and oak, and significantly lower for spruce. The indices of soil C turnover were largely consistent and some were significantly correlated. Differences in C turnover were for the most part attributable to variation in litter quality and microclimatic conditions. Litterfall foliar N, Ca and Mg concentrations and to some extent lignin concentration correlated best with C turnover indices that integrated the forest floor. The results suggests that specific traits of Norway spruce and these five common broadleaf forest species should be taken into account in the modelling of soil C stock dynamics over decades.",

A better understanding of variations in the dynamics and structure of tropical forests is necessary for predicting the potential for these ecosystems to lose or store carbon, and for understanding how they recover from disturbance. Amazonian tropical forests occur over a vast area that encompasses differences in topography, climate, and geologic substrate. We observed large differences in forest structure, biomass, and tree growth rates in permanent plots situated in the eastern (near Santarem, Para), central (near Manaus, Amazonas) and southwestern (near Rio Branco, Acre) Amazon, which differed in dry season length, as well as other factors. Forests at the two sites experiencing longer dry seasons, near Rio Branco and Santarem, had lower stem frequencies (460 and 466Â ha-1 respectively), less biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity index), and smaller aboveground C stocks (140.6 and 122.1Â Mg CÂ ha-1) than the Manaus site (626 treesÂ ha-1, 180.1Â Mg CÂ ha-1), which had less seasonal variation in rainfall. The forests experiencing longer dry seasons also stored a greater proportion of the total biomass in trees with >50Â cm diameter (41-45 vs 30% in Manaus). Rates of annual addition of C to living trees calculated from monthly dendrometer band measurements were 1.9 (Manaus), 2.8 (Santarem), and 2.6 (Rio Branco) Mg CÂ ha-1Â year-1. At all sites, trees in the 10-30Â cm diameter class accounted for the highest proportion of annual growth (38, 55 and 56% in Manaus, Rio Branco and Santarem, respectively). Growth showed marked seasonality, with largest stem diameter increment in the wet season and smallest in the dry season, though this may be confounded by seasonal variation in wood water content. Year-to-year variations in C allocated to stem growth ranged from nearly zero in Rio Branco, to 0.8Â Mg CÂ ha-1Â year-1 in Manaus (40% of annual mean) and 0.9Â Mg CÂ ha-1Â year-1 (33% of annual mean) in Santarem, though this variability showed no significant relation with precipitation among years. Initial estimates of the C balance of live wood including recruitment and mortality as well as growth suggests that live wood biomass is at near steady-state in Manaus, but accumulating at about 1.5Â Mg CÂ ha-1 at the other two sites. The causes of C imbalance in living wood pools in Santarem and Rio Branco sites are unknown, but may be related to previous disturbance at these sites. Based on size distribution and growth rate differences in the three sites, we predict that trees in the Manaus forest have greater mean age (~240Â years) than those of the other two forests (~140Â years).",

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the dominance by Peltogyne is associated with an unusual litterfall mass, nutrient concentrations, or retranslocation. Three plots (50 x 50 m) were set up in each of three forest types: (1) Peltogyne-rich forest (PRFa), dominated by Peltogyne gracilipes; (2) Peltogyne-poor forest (PPF), with a sparse occurrence of Peltogyne; and (3) forest without Peltogyne (FWPa). Litterfall was collected for 360 d at ca 15-d intervals in 11 randomly positioned traps (0.32 m2) per plot. Mature Peltogyne leaves were collected at random from three randomly selected understory Peltogyne trees in each of the three PRFa plots during the early dry and early wet season. Additionally, young Peltogyne leaves were collected during the early wet season. Chemical analyses were made on bulked (on a 2-mo basis) litterfall samples and young and mature Peltogyne leaves. The estimated annual litterfall was similar among PRFa (7.9 t/ha), PPF (9.1 t/ha) and FWPa (8.6 t/ha); however, PRFa was distinguished by its litterfall seasonality, because of the deciduous Peltogyne, and its higher concentrations of Ca (9.3 compared to 6.5 mg/g in FWPa) and Mg (3.2 compared to 1.9mg/g in FWPa). About 40-50 percent of N and P, 25-41 percenr of K, and 2-13 percent of Mg were rerranslocated from Peltogyne leaves. RESUMOes A Ilha de Maraca localiza-se na borda entre a Floresta Amazi´nica e a Savana de Rio Branco-Rupunini. A precipitaicoo media anual e de 1800 mm, com uma estaicoo seca de outubro a marico e uma chuvosa de abril a setembro. Uma floresta dominada pela especie arborea Peltogyne gracilipes (Cesalpiniaceae) ocorre em regioes da Ilha de Maraca e areas adjacentes. Esta floresta e a mais pobre em espcies (para arvores > 10 cm DAP) reportada para a Amazi´nia brasileira. O objetivo deste estudo foi testar a hipotese de que a dominancia de Peltogyne esta associada com a produicoo de serrapiiheira, com a concentraicoo de nutrientes ou com a retranslocaicoo. Triªs parcelas (50 x 50 m) foram alocadas aleatoriamente em cada um dos triªs tipos florestais estudados: (1) floresta rica em Peltogyne (PRFa), dominada por Peltogyne gracilipes; (2) floresta pobre em Peltogyne (PPF), com a ocorriªncia esparsa de Peltogyne; e (3) floresta sem Peltogyne (FWPa). A serrapiiheira foi coletada em 11 coletores (0,32 m2) por parcela, posicionados randomicamente, durante 360 d em intervalos de aproximadamente 15 d. Folhas maduras de Peltogyne foram coletadas ao acaso em triªs arvores de Peltogyne selecionadas aleatoriamente em cada uma das triªs parcelas na PRFa, no incio da estaicoo seca e no inicio da chuvosa. Em adiicoo, folhas novas de Peltogyne foram coletadas no incio da estaicoo chuvosa. Analises quimicas foram feitas em amostras compostas (de dois meses) de serrapilheira e em folhas novas e maduras de Peltogyne. A produicoo anual de serrapiiheira estimada foi similar entre a PRFa (7,9 t/ha), PPF (9,1 t/ha) e a FWPa (8,6 t/ha). Entretanto, a queda de serrapiiheira na PRFa diferenciou-se por sua sasonalidade, ocasionada pelas folhas de Peltogyne, e pelas maiores concentraicoes de Ca (9,3 comparado com 6,5 mg/g na FWPa) e Mg (3,2 comparado com 1,9 mg/g na FWPa). Aproximadamente 40-50 porcento de N e de P, 25 a 41 porcento de K e 2 a 13 porcento de Mg foram retranslocados das folhas de Peltogyne. ",

Using a bivariate model (RMSE=1.03), both optimal soil water content for soil respiration (WSO) and soil respiration at both 10Â Â°C and optimal soil water content (RS10) varied among plots, ranging, respectively, from 0.25 to 0.40 and from 2.30 to 3.60Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1.

These results offer promising perspectives for spatializing ecosystem carbon budget at the regional scale.",

Trees in paved impervious areas often suffer from a poor root zone environment. The objective of this experiment was to test if use of pervious concrete could be more beneficial for root growth and consequently a better alternative towards preserving existing mature trees during urban development. We measured root activity through CO2 flux, and also measured root production of American sweetgum under impervious concrete, pervious concrete and no pavement conditions (control). Soil under impervious concrete had lower oxygen concentrations than soil under pervious concrete and control treatments, particularly under wet conditions. Soil under pervious concrete had a 0.020Â m3Â m-3 (2% volumetric water content (VWC)) greater volumetric water content than soils paved with impervious concrete. Soil CO2 efflux rates and soil CO2 concentrations were extremely high under both concrete treatments. Standing live root length at the end of the experiment was greater under the control treatment than under both concrete treatments and these changes in root production were likely due to high soil CO2 concentrations under both pervious and impervious concrete. The soil type at our site, which is a Ships clay with a very low permeability rate, may have limited CO2 exchange through the pervious pavement. On this heavy clay soil, pervious concrete did not convey any measurable root growth benefits over impervious concrete.",

We measured the root and microbial components of soil respiration near Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2000 and 2001, in three black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill) B.S.P.) forests. We hypothesized faster decomposition correlates with greater amounts of both root and microbial contributions to soil respiration. Contrary to our prediction, the site with the coolest summer soil temperatures and slowest decomposition (site identification ""high-np"") had significantly (p < 0.05) greater growing season soil respiration (485 g CÂ·m<U+0096>2Â·year<U+0096>1) than the two other sites (372 and 332 g CÂ·m<U+0096>2Â·year<U+0096>1). Spruce C allocation to root respiration was significantly greater, and fine-root N concentration was 10% and 12% greater (p < 0.05) at high-np than at the other two sites. High-np spruce foliage was also more enriched in 13C and depleted in 15N, suggesting either lower available moisture or slower N turnover. Either factor could drive greater C allocation to roots; however, a literature review suggests moisture deficit corresponds to greater C allocation to roots in black spruce forests across the boreal ecosystem. Controls on spruce C allocation need to be resolved before making the generalization that soil respiration will increase with warming in this forest type.",

Forest floor CO2 flux was measured using an openflow infrared gas analyzer measurement system for 24Â h periods and samples were taken every 2 months over a 2-year period. Litter/soil interface, soil temperature (5Â cm depth), soil moisture (%), forest floor moisture (%), forest floor mass, fine root (<U+2A7D>2Â mm) mass, coarse root mass (>2Â mm), forest floor C and N (%), fine root C and N, coarse root C and N, and soil N and C were co-measured during each sample period. Results showed significant nonlinear relationships (r2=0.68 to 0.81) between litter/soil interface temperature and forest floor CO2 flux for all three forest age classes, but no differences in temperature response parameters. These results indicated no differences in forest floor CO2 flux among age classes. Considerable temporal variation in abiotic and biotic variables was observed within and among forests. Biotic variables correlated with forest floor CO2 flux included indices of litter and root quality. Differences in biotic variables correlated with forest floor CO2 flux among forests may have been related to shifts in the relative importance of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration components to overall forest floor CO2 flux.",

Measurements were made between August 1999 and July 2001 and were used to develop nonlinear statistical models to assess daily variations in ecophysiological parameters and provide annual estimates of NEE, gross ecosystem CO2 exchange (GEE), and respiration (Re). Diurnal trends in NEE were correlated with variations in photosynthetic photon flux density (Q), vapor pressure deficit (V), and temperature. Seasonal trends in the CO2-flux components estimated from nonlinear regression (Amax and R0) were highly correlated with soil water availability and canopy structural properties (LAI and litter production). These results suggest that variations in soil water content can affect rates of canopy photosynthesis and whole forest respiration by altering both physiological processes and canopy structural properties. Estimates of the annual NEE suggest that the forest was in balance with respect to CO2 during the study period, which, in terms of rainfall, was a relatively typical period compared to the 30-yr average rainfall regime. Our results also suggest that the warmer and dryer microclimate and decline in LAI that accompany land-cover change will cause transitional forests to be sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. ",

Carbon fluxes to and from these ecosystems in response to climate change have the potential to alter global climate. To understand how forest carbon budgets may be affected by climate, we observed patterns of carbon storage, forest structure, and composition in Scots pine forest ecosystems at nine sites along a northern latitudinal gradient (50-70Â°N) crossing Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. This gradient is characterized by a northward decline in average annual temperature (<U+0394>Â =Â ca. 9Â°C) and precipitation (<U+0394>Â =Â ca. 300Â mm). Total ecosystem carbon, decomposition rates, and litterfall amounts all decreased nonlinearly with increasing latitude. Plant species richness in the ground flora also decreased with increasing latitude. However, the percent cover of lower canopy vegetation varied asystematically with respect to latitude, temperature, or precipitation. Our results are largely consistent with models and analyses indicating that northern latitude forests may respond to predicted climate changes with increased carbon sequestration. In the short term, however, these forests may be a source rather than a sink for atmospheric carbon as the relative distribution of C among ecosystem components adjusts in response to changing climatic conditions.",

It has been widely accepted that an increase in temperature would accelerate microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and provide a positive feedback to global warming, other factors being equal. However, soil moisture has received little attention in C cycle studies. In this project, we developed a technique for sampling soil-respired CO2 for isotopic measurements and a model that relates the radiocarbon (14C) content of soil respired CO2 to the rate of C cycling in soils. We measured soil CO2 flux, carbon isotopic content (both 13C and 14C) of soil-respired CO2, soil temperature, and soil moisture on a monthly basis along an elevation transect in the Sierra Nevada in an attempt to determine the relationship between the rate of soil C cycling and soil environmental conditions. Both soil CO2 flux and its 14C content displayed significant variations (spatially and temporally), which reflect natural variations in the rate of SOM decomposition and in the relative amount of SOM-derived CO2 versus root-respired CO2 caused by seasonal changes in soil temperature, moisture, and plant activity. The relative contribution of SOM decomposition to total soil CO2 production changed throughout the year from ~20-50% at the peak of the growing season to close to 100% in the nongrowing season. The apparent decay rate of SOM determined from the 14C content of soil-respired CO2 varied from ~0.2 yr-1 in the spring to ~0.01 yr-1 in the fall at the lowest-elevation site and from 0.1 yr-1 in the summer to ~0.01 yr-1 in the late fall at the highest-elevation site. It appears that the apparent decay rate of SOM increased with increasing temperature when soil moisture was adequate but decreased with increasing temperature when soil moisture became limited. The apparent decay rate of SOM also varied with soil moisture. Higher soil moisture content accelerated decomposition of SOM until it reached an optimal level of ~14-25 wt % water content and then inhibited decomposition when more pores in soils became saturated with water and perhaps oxygen availability (for microbes) became limited. Although the rate of SOM decomposition varied throughout the year in response to fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture, the maximum apparent decay rate was higher at the low-elevation site (i.e., maximum apparent decay rate = 0.22 yr-1) than at the high-elevation sites (i.e., maximum apparent decay rate = 0.10 yr-1). Litter decomposition simulated by measuring changes in mass of litter in litter bags placed in the field also showed a similar decomposition pattern with decreasing decomposition rate with elevation. Multivariable regression analyses including various terms of soil temperature, moisture, and site variability suggest that soil moisture was a major factor, but not the only factor, controlling the rate of SOM decomposition and soil CO2 flux in the Sierra Nevada soils. Both decay rate and total soil CO2 flux are related significantly to soil moisture, temperature, and site effects. ",

However, few carbon budgets exist for these forests, and the effects of wildfire, the dominant natural disturbance in this region, on carbon budgets are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of wildfire on carbon distribution and net primary production (NPP) for three major Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) forest ecosystems in Tahe, Daxing'anling, north-eastern China: Larix gmelinii-Ledum palustre, Larix gmelinii-grass and Larix gmelinii-Rhododendron dahurica forests. The experimental design included mature forests (unburned), and lightly and heavily burned forests from the 1.3-million-ha 1987 wildfire. We measured carbon distribution and above-ground NPP, and estimated fine root production from literature values. Total ecosystem carbon content for the mature forests was greatest for Larix-Ledum forests (251.4 t C ha-1) and smallest for Larix-grass forests (123.8 t C ha-1). Larix-Ledum forests contained the smallest vegetation carbon (13.5%), while Larix-Rhododendron contained the largest vegetation carbon (63.1%). Fires tended to transfer carbon from vegetation to detritus and soil. Total NPP did not differ significantly between the lightly burned and unburned stands, and averaged 1.58, 1.29 and 1.01 t C ha-1 year-1 for Larix-grass, Larix-Rhododendron and Larix-Ledum lightly burned stands, respectively. Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of heavily burned stands was 92-95% less than unburned and lightly burned stands. The estimated carbon loss during the 1987 fire showed substantial variability among forest types and fire severity levels. Depending upon the assumptions made about the fraction of the landscape occupied by the three larch forest types, the 1987 conflagration in north-east China released 2.5 x 107-4.9 x 107 t C to the atmosphere. This study illustrates the need to distinguish between the different larch forests for developing general carbon budgets. ",

Soil surface CO2 flux (Rs), the second largest C flux in boreal forests, is directly and indirectly affected by fire and is hypothesized to change during forest succession following fire. The overall objective of this study was to measure and model Rs for a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) postfire chronosequence in northern Manitoba, Canada. The experiment design was a nested factorial that included two soil drainage classes (well and poorly drained) x seven postfire aged stands. Specific objectives were (1) to quantify the relationship between Rs and soil temperature for different aged boreal black spruce forests in well-drained and poorly drained soil conditions, (2) to examine Rs dynamics along postfire successional stands, and (3) to estimate annual soil surface CO2 flux for these ecosystems. Soil surface CO2 flux was significantly affected by soil drainage class (p = 0.014) and stand age (p = 0.006). Soil surface CO2 flux was positively correlated to soil temperature (R2 = 0.78, p < 0.001), but different models were required for each drainage class x aged stand combination. Soil surface CO2 flux was significantly greater at the well-drained than the poorly drained stands (p = 0.007) during growing season. Annual soil surface CO2 flux for the 1998, 1995, 1989, 1981, 1964, 1930, and 1870 burned stands averaged 226, 412, 357, 413, 350, 274, and 244 g C m-2 yr-1 in the well-drained stands and 146, 380, 300, 303, 256, 233, and 264 g C m-2 yr-1 in the poorly drained stands. Soil surface CO2 flux during the winter (from 1 November to 30 April) comprised from 5 to 19% of the total annual Rs. We speculate that the smaller soil surface CO2 flux in the recently burned than the older stands is mainly caused by decreased root respiration. ",

BSP) stands comprising a fire chronosequence in northern Manitoba, Canada. The experimental design included seven well-drained (dry) and seven poorly-drained (wet) stands that burned between 1998 and 1850. Vegetation C pools (above-ground + below-ground) steadily increased from 1.3 to 83.3 t C ha-1 for the dry chronosequence, and from 0.6 to 37.4 t C ha-1 for the wet chronosequence. The detritus C pools (woody debris + forest floor) varied from 10.3 to 96.0 t C ha-1 and from 12.6 to 77.4 t C ha-1 for the dry and wet chronosequence, respectively. Overstorey biomass, mean annual biomass increment (MAI), woody debris mass, and litterfall were significantly greater (a = 0.05) for the dry stands than for the wet stands, but the bryophyte, understorey, and forest floor C pools were significantly less for the dry than for the wet stands. The root mass ratio decreased with stand age until 37 years after fire, was fairly constant thereafter, and was not significantly affected by soil drainage. The C pools of the overstorey and bryophyte tended to increase with stand age. Foliage biomass, litterfall, and MAI (for the dry stands) peaked at 71 years after fire and declined in the oldest stands. The results from this study illustrate that the effects of disturbance and edaphic conditions must be accounted for in boreal forest C inventories and C models. The appropriateness of using chronosequences to examine effects of wildfire on ecosystem C distribution is discussed. ",

Eddy flux measurements showed that the growing Scots pine forest was a sink for CO2, with annual net C uptakes of 131, 210 and 258 g C m-2> year-1 in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The integrated process model reproduced the annual course of daily C flux above the forest canopy as measured by the eddy covariance method once the site-specific component parameters were estimated. The model explained 72, 66 and 68% of the variation in daily net C flux in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Modeled annual C loss by respiration was 565, 629 and 640 g C m-2 year-1, accounting for 77, 77 and 65% of annual gross C uptake, respectively. Carbon fluxes from the forest floor were the dominant contributors to forest ecosystem respiration, with the fractions of annual respiration from the forest floor, foliage and wood being 46-62, 27-44 and 9-10%, respectively. The wide range in daily net C uptake during the growing season was largely attributable to day-to-day fluctuations in incident quantum irradiance. During just a few days in early spring and late autumn, ecosystem net C exchange varied between source and sink as a result of large daily changes in temperature. The forest showed a greater reduction in gross C uptake by photosynthesis than in C loss by respiration during the dry summer of 2000, indicating that interannual variability in ecosystem net C uptake at this site was modified mostly by summer rainfall and vapor pressure deficit.",

In view of the fact that studies on carbon exchange for this important biome have been very limited, we have initiated a long-term flux observation in a larch forest ecosystem in Hokkaido in northern Japan since 2000. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) showed large seasonal and diurnal variation. Generally, the larch forest ecosystem released CO2 in nighttime and assimilated CO2 in daytime during the growing season from May to October. The ecosystem started to become a net carbon sink in May, reaching a maximum carbon uptake as high as 186Â g CÂ m-2Â month-1 in June. With the yellowing, senescing and leaf fall, the ecosystem turned into a carbon source in November. During the non-growing season, the larch forest ecosystem became a net source of CO2, releasing an average of 16.7Â g CÂ m-2Â month-1. Overall, the ecosystem sequestered 141-240Â g CÂ m-2Â yr-1 in 2001. The NEE was significantly influenced by environmental factors. Respiration of the ecosystem, for example, was exponentially dependent on air temperature, while photosynthesis was related to the incident PAR in a manner consistent with the Michaelis-Menten model. Although the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was scarcely higher than 15Â hPa, the CO2 uptake rate was also depressed when VPD surpassed 10Â hPa.",

In this study, allometric equations were developed relating component biomass to diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) to DBH for 10 co-occurring tree species in the Chinese temperate mixed forest. The 10 species were Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.), Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.), white birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.), Amur cork-tree (Phellodendron amurense Rupr.), Manchurian walnut (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.), Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr.), aspen (Populous davidiana Dode), maple (Acer mono Maxim.), and Amur linden (Tilia amurensis Rupr.). The biomass components included stem, current-year branch, older branch, current-year foliage, older foliage, stump, and coarse root (diameter =5Â mm). Harvested tree DBH ranged from 2.4 to 57.1Â cm. Generalized biomass allometric equations that ignored tree species, based on DBH and fitted on a log-log scale, explained more than 90% of variability in woody component biomass, but the species effect was significant (aÂ =Â 0.05). Including tree height as the second independent variable in the allometric equations improved the accuracy of biomass estimates, especially for foliage biomass. The relative differences in biomass estimated from the generalized, DBH-only, and DBH-H combined equations varied from -50.6% to 43.9% depending upon model form, species, and biomass component. Foliage biomass was more variable than other component biomass both across and within tree species. Some potential sources of error in biomass estimation were also discussed.",

However, few studies on RS are available for Chinese temperate forest despite the importance of this forest in the national and global carbon budgets. In this study, we conducted 18-month RS measurements during 2004-2005 in six temperate forest types, representing the typical secondary forest ecosystems across various site conditions in northeastern China: Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.), aspen-birch (Populous davidiana Dode and Betula platyphylla Suk.), mixed deciduous (no dominant tree species), hardwood (dominated by Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr., Juglans mandshurica Maxim., and Phellodendron amurense Rupr.) forests, Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.) and Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) plantations. Our specific objectives were to: (1) explore relationships of RS against soil temperature and water content for the six forest ecosystems, (2) quantify annual soil surface CO2 flux and its relations to belowground carbon storage, (3) examine seasonal variations in RS and related environmental factors, and (4) quantify among- and within-ecosystem variations in RS. The RS was positively correlated to soil temperature in all forest types, and was significantly influenced by the interactions of soil temperature and water content in the pine, larch, and mixed deciduous forests. The sensitivity of RS to soil temperature at 10 cm depth (Q10) ranged from 2.61 in the oak forest to 3.75 in the aspen-birch forests. The Q10 tended to increase with soil water content until reaching a threshold, and then decline. The annual RS for the larch, pine, hardwood, oak, mixed deciduous, and aspen-birch forests averaged 403, 514, 781, 785, 786, and 813 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively. The annual RS of the broadleaved forests was 72% greater than that of the coniferous forests. The annual RS was positively correlated to soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration at O horizon (R2=0.868) and total biomass of roots <0.5 cm in diameter (R2=0.748). The coefficient of variation (CV) of RS among forest types averaged 25% across the 18-month measurements. The CV of RS within plots varied from 20% to 27%, significantly (P<0.001) greater than those among plots (9-15%), indicating the importance of the fine-scaled heterogeneity in RS. This study emphasized that variations in soil respiration and potential sampling bias should be appropriately tackled for accurate soil CO2 flux estimates. ",

In this study, we used a trenching plot approach to partition RS in six temperate forests in northeastern China. Our specific objectives were to (1) examine seasonal patterns of soil surface CO2 fluxes from trenched (RT) and untrenched plots (RUT) of these forests; (2) quantify annual fluxes of RS components and their relative contributions in the forest ecosystems; and (3) examine effects of plot trenching on measurements of RS and related environmental factors. The RT maximized in early growing season, but the difference between RUT and RT peaked in later summer. The annual fluxes of RH and RR varied with forest types. The estimated values of RH for the Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.), Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.), aspen-birch (Populous davidiana Dode and Betula platyphylla Suk.), hardwood (Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr., Juglans mandshurica Maxim. and Phellodendron amurense Rupr.), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.) and mixed deciduous (no dominant tree species) forests averaged 89, 196, 187, 245, 261 and 301 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively; those of RR averaged 424, 209, 628, 538, 524 and 483 g C m-2 yr-1, correspondingly; calculated contribution of RR to RS (RC) varied from 52% in the larch forest to 83% in the pine forest. The annual flux of RR was strongly correlated to biomass of roots <0.5 cm in diameter, while that of RH was weakly correlated to soil organic carbon concentration at A horizon. We concluded that vegetation type and associated carbon metabolisms of temperate forests should be considered in assessing and modeling RS components. The significant impacts of changed soil physical environments and substrate availability by plot trenching should be appropriately tackled in analyzing and interpreting measurements of RS components.

The continuous carbon fluxes were measured from May 2004 to April 2005 in the Dahurian larch forest in Northeast China using an eddy covariance method. The results showed that the ecosystem released carbon in the dormant season from mid-October 2004 to April 2005, while it assimilated CO2 from the atmosphere in the growing season from May to September 2004. The net carbon sequestration reached its peak of 112 gÂ·m-2Â·month-1 in June 2004 (simplified expression of g (carbon)Â·m-2Â·month-1) and then gradually decreased. Annually, the larch forest was a carbon sink that sequestered carbon of 146 gÂ·m-2Â·a-1 (simplified expression of g (carbon)Â·m-2Â·a-1) during the measurements. The photosynthetic process of the larch forest ecosystem was largely affected by the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature. Under humid conditions (VPD < 1.0 kPa), the gross ecosystem production (GEP) increased with increasing temperature. But the net ecosystem production (NEP) showed almost no change with increasing temperature because the increment of GEP was counterbalanced by that of the ecosystem respiration. Under a dry environment (VPD > 1.0 kPa), the GEP decreased with the increasing VPD at a rate of 3.0 ÂµmolÂ·m-2Â·s-Â·kPa-1 and the ecosystem respiration was also enhanced simultaneously due to the increase of air temperature, which was linearly correlated with the VPD. As a result, the net ecosystem carbon sequestration rapidly decreased with the increasing VPD at a rate of 5.2 ÂµmolÂ·m-2Â·s-1Â·kPa-1. Under humid conditions (VPD < 1.0 kPa), both the GEP and NEP were obviously restricted by the low air temperature but were insensitive to the high temperature because the observed high temperature value comes within the category of the optimum range.",

The eddy covariance system was used as a reference, which was compared with the chamber-based method. Based on chamber fluxes, the ecosystem had a gross primary production of 1490 g C m-2 year-1, 90% of which was released as efflux back into the air via respiration of the entire ecosystem. This was comprised of about 48% from soil surface CO2 efflux, 31% from leaf respiration and 21% from stem and branch respiration. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE), estimated from the sum of daily component fluxes, was 146 g C m-2 year-1. Ecosystem respiration (ER), estimated from the sum of daily ecosystem respiration, was 1240 g C m-2 year-1. NEE was 9.8% of actual gross primary production (GPP). The eddy covariance estimates of NEE, ER and GPP were 188, 1030 and 1220 g C m-2 year-1, respectively. The eddy covariance estimation of NEE was higher than that of the chamber-based estimation by 22.5%. On a daily basis, NEE of the scaled chamber measurements was in acceptable agreement with eddy covariance measurement data with R2 values of 0.71. The discrepancy between the measurement of the two methods was greater in the non-growing season primarily due to the lack of spatial variability in the scaled chamber estimates and weak atmosphere turbulence by eddy covariance measurements. There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of ecosystem component flux. More detailed experiments and related theoretical studies are needed in the future.",

Forest types included an old-growth, mixed coniferous and broad-leaved primary forest (MN), a middle-aged, broad-leaved secondary forest (BL), and a young coniferous plantation forest (CP).

Differences in soil temperature among those sites were not statistically significant but contributed to the differences in annual CO2 efflux. In addition, the temperature response of soil CO2 efflux was higher at MN (Q10 = 2.78) than that at BL (Q10 = 2.17) and CP (Q10 = 2.02).

These ubiquitous land use changes can be significant contributors to the dynamics of the global carbon budget. However, the effects of these land use dynamics (i.e., secondary succession) on carbon cycling, and particularly on soil CO2 efflux, are rather sparsely addressed in the literature. Variations in soil CO2 flux during secondary succession may explain the hypothesized shift from carbon source to carbon sink as succession proceeds. We investigated soil CO2 flux of early, mid, and late succession ecosystems in northern Virginia from 2003 to 2006. Soil temperature, moisture, total carbon, total nitrogen, and soil C/N were measured along with soil CO2 flux. Despite the wide array of changes in both physical conditions and vegetation composition/structure that occur during successional shifts, our results showed that soil CO2 flux did not vary throughout succession. Our results support previous findings that soil temperature has a major influence on soil CO2 flux, and we additionally found that the overall sensitivity of soil CO2 flux to soil temperature did not change during succession. Soil moisture had a significant influence on soil CO2 flux only at the two driest sites within the successional sequences (one early and one late successional site), where both root and microbial activities are potentially limited by soil water conditions. The monthly soil CO2 fluxes were significantly different among successional stages in 9 out of the 12 months during the year. The soil CO2 fluxes showed strong seasonality and differences among sites within seasons; however, these differences balanced out at the annual scale. The invariance in annual soil CO2 fluxes throughout succession may indicate that soil CO2 flux overall is independent of any shift from early succession carbon source to later succession carbon sink. Results also indicate that annual soil CO2 budgets are likely determined by the climatic conditions under which succession proceeds. While the transient vegetation types of secondary succession alter the seasonal soil CO2 fluxes, they may not affect the annual soil CO2 output. ",

In tundra and boreal forest ecosystems, cumulative winter soil CO2 fluxes are reported to be a significant component of their annual carbon budgets. However, little information on winter soil CO2 efflux is known from mid-latitude ecosystems. Therefore, comparing measurements of soil respiration taken annually versus during the growing season will improve the accuracy of ecosystem carbon budgets and the response of soil CO2 efflux to climate changes. In this study we measured winter soil CO2 efflux and its contribution to annual soil respiration for seven ecosystems (three forests: Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica plantation, Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation and Betula platyphylla forest; two shrubs: Rosa bella and Malus baccata; and two meadow grasslands) in a forest-steppe ecotone, north China. Overall mean winter and growing season soil CO2 effluxes were 0.15-0.26Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 and 2.65-4.61Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1, respectively, with significant differences in the growing season among the different ecosystems. Annual Q10 (increased soil respiration rate per 10Â Â°C increase in temperature) was generally higher than the growing season Q10. Soil water content accounted for 84% of the variations in growing season Q10 and soil temperature range explained 88% of the variation in annual Q10. Soil organic carbon density to 30Â cm depth was a good surrogate for SR10 (basal soil respiration at a reference temperature of 10Â Â°C). Annual soil CO2 efflux ranged from 394.76Â gÂ CÂ m-2 to 973.18Â gÂ CÂ m-2 using observed ecosystem-specific response equations between soil respiration and soil temperature. Estimates ranged from 424.90Â gÂ CÂ m-2 to 784.73Â gÂ CÂ m-2 by interpolating measured soil respiration between sampling dates for every day of the year and then computing the sum to obtain the annual value. The contributions of winter soil CO2 efflux to annual soil respiration were 3.48-7.30% and 4.92-7.83% using interpolated and modeled methods, respectively. Our results indicate that in mid-latitude ecosystems, soil CO2 efflux continues throughout the winter and winter soil respiration is an important component of annual CO2 efflux.",

Field measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) using either eddy covariance or chamber methods usually provide bulk CO2 fluxes from more than one sink or source. For the purpose of estimating the C budget in ecosystems, it is inherently important to determine the individual sinks or sources. This report describes how we tested the Forest-DNDC model using a dataset collected at a subtropical forest site in Sichuan Province, China. One-year field measurements were conducted using a chamber method at four plots with different treatments that were specifically designed to distinguish the CO2 fluxes produced from three sources: root respiration, forest floor respiration and mineral soil respiration. The obtained datasets were utilized to verify the modeled CO2 fluxes from the corresponding sources for the tested forest ecosystem. Results from the tests indicated that Forest-DNDC was capable not only of quantifying the total CO2 emissions but also of distinguishing their sources related to plant autotrophic and soil microbial heterotrophic respiration. Because measuring root respiration is always difficult in field investigations, adopting Forest-DNDC for quantifying root respiration represents an appropriate complement to most field measurements.",

Multivariate analysis of covariance with soil temperature (T) and soil water content (SWC) as the covariates showed that FT and AL as the independent factors had a significant effect on R S (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). The R S in the CF differed significantly from EB and MB (P<0.001), but not between EB and MB. The R S was positively correlated with T, and responded to changes in SWC at higher Ts. The correlation between R S and SWC was improved when the R S was normalized to 10Â°C. Annual mean R S differed significantly with SA and were ranked in the order (from high to low) of 21-25, 26-35, 11-20, >36, and 1-10 years.

The overall objective of this study was to measure and model soil respiration and its components in a mixed forest plantation with native species in south China and to assess the effects of understory species management on soil respiration and on the contribution of root respiration (Rr) to total soil respiration (Rs). An experiment was conducted in a plantation containing a mixture of 30 native tree species and in which understory plants had been removed or replaced by Cassia alata Linn. The four treatments were the control (Control), C. alata addition (CA), understory removal (UR) and understory removal with C. alata addition (URÂ +Â CA). Trenched subplots were used to quantify Rr by comparing Rs outside the 1-m2 trenched subplots (plants and roots present) and inside the trenched subplots (plants and roots absent) in each treatment. Annual soil respiration were modeled using the values measured for Rs, soil temperature and soil moisture. Our results indicate that understory removal reduced Rs rate and soil moisture but increased soil temperature. Regression models revealed that soil temperature was the main factor and soil moisture was secondary. Understory manipulations and trenching increased the temperature sensitivity of Rs. Annual Rs for the Control, CA, UR and URÂ +Â CA treatments averaged 594, 718, 557 and 608Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â yr-1, respectively. UR decreased annual Rs by 6%, but CA increased Rs by about 21%.

Interannual variation of RS was studied using a 6-year data set collected in a subtropical plantation dominated by an exotic species, slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.), in China. The results showed that seasonal variation of RS was significantly affected by soil temperature and soil water content (SWC). RS in the dry season (July-October) was constrained by seasonal drought. Mean annual RS was estimated to be 736Â Â± 30Â gÂ CÂ·m-2Â·year-1, with a range of 706-790Â gÂ CÂ·m-2Â·year-1. Although this forest was characterized by a humid climate with high precipitation (1469Â mmÂ·year-1), the interannual variation of RS was attributed to the changes of annual mean SWC (R2 = 0.66, P = 0.03), which was affected by annual rainfall frequency (R2 = 0.80, PÂ < 0.01) and not rainfall amount (P = 0.84). Consequently, precipitation pattern indirectly controlled the interannual variation of RS by affecting soil moisture in this subtropical forest. In the context of climate change, interannual variation of RS in subtropical ecosystems is expected to increase because of the predicted changes of precipitation regime.",

We hypothesized that (i) an optimal sampling setup can be found to obtain a reliable annual RS, and (ii) if the desired outcome is a multi-year mean annual RS, a lower sampling frequency might be adequate. Here we explored these issues using a three-year chamber-based dataset, with a sampling frequency of twice per week (defined as control), in an exotic slash pine (Pinus elliottii Englem.) plantation in subtropical China. The results showed that RS during 9:00-11:00Â a.m. represented diurnal mean RS well. In order to obtain an annual RS as reliable as the control (deviation within Â±5%), the optimal measurement strategy is a biweekly sampling across a year and not a trade-off sampling pattern (monthly sampling combined with weekly sampling depending on the seasons). Furthermore, despite an obvious inter-annual variability in RS (548.4-757.5Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1, CVÂ =Â 16.3%), a monthly sampling was sufficient to obtain an unbiased multi-year mean annual RS (deviation within Â±5%).

The response of RL to rainfall and soil moisture was significantly more sensitive than that of RS-L. Furthermore, the effects of rainfall and soil moisture on RS, RL, and RL:RS were higher during the dry season (July-December) than during the wet season (January-June).

Therefore, a field debris exclusion experiment and a laboratory debris addition experiment were conducted to assess the response of soil CO2 efflux to C input manipulation. Our experiments were the first to be conducted in a subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation. The field debris exclusion experiment included the following treatments: leaf litter exclusion (NL), leaf litter and root exclusion (NLR), and control (CT). In the laboratory experiment, leaf litter and fine and coarse roots were added to soils collected from the same site and incubated for 100Â days at 15.0Â Â°C using the isotopic partitioning approach to determine the priming effect on soil C. The field-experimental results showed that soil CO2 efflux decreased significantly by 22.9% and 49.1% in the NL and NLR plots, respectively, compared with the CT plots. However, debris exclusion did not affect the diurnal and seasonal patterns of soil CO2 efflux. The contributions of leaf litter and roots to total soil CO2 efflux were 22.9% and 26.2%, respectively, which were positively related to soil temperature and moisture. In the laboratory experiment, the cumulative amount of soil CO2 efflux increased 1.25, 0.51, and 0.43 times in the soils with leaf litter, fine root, and coarse root additions, respectively, compared with the control soil (without debris addition) at the end of the incubation period. The amount of CO2 derived from leaf litter, fine root, and coarse root additions accounted for 44.0%, 31.1%, and 27.9% of the total amount of soil CO2 efflux, respectively. During the experimental period, the priming effect induced by fast-decomposing leaf litter (25.9%) was significantly higher than the priming effect induced by slow-decomposing fine roots (3.8%) and coarse roots (2.9%). The priming effect was negatively correlated with the initial lignin content and the lignin:N ratios of the added debris. The similar contributions of leaf litter and roots to soil CO2 efflux from the field experiment and the greater contributions of the priming of leaf litters to the fluxes from the laboratory experiment suggest that root inputs are more important than litter inputs in regulating soil C storage in Chinese fir forests.",

Net primary production (NPP) also increased from early to late succession. The results follow the proposed conceptual model that successional ecosystems are carbon sources at the beginning of secondary succession and then become carbon sinks, but the progression is not linear.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the switching point of secondary succession from releasing carbon to sequestering carbon in a temperate, humid climate is approximately between 5 and 19Â years following agricultural abandonment.",

We measured soil respiration and partitioned the HR and AR components across three age classes ~15, ~25, and ~35-year-old Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (Mongolia pine) and Larix principis-rupprechtii (larch) in a forest-steppe ecotone, northern China (June 2006 to October 2009). We analyzed the relationship between seasonal dynamics of SR, HR, AR and soil temperature (ST), soil water content (SWC) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, a plant greenness and net primary productivity indicator). Our results showed that ST and SWC were driving factors for the seasonal dynamics of SR rather than plant greenness, irrespective of stand age and forest type. For ~15-year-old stands, the seasonal dynamics of both AR and HR were dependent on ST. Higher Q10 of HR compared with AR occurred in larch. However, in Mongolia pine a similar Q10 occurred between HR and AR. With stand age, Q10 of both HR and AR increased in larch. For Mongolia pine, Q10 of HR increased with stand age, but AR showed no significant relationship with ST. As stand age increased, HR was correlated with SWC in Mongolia pine, but for larch AR correlated with SWC. The dependence of AR on NDVI occurred in ~35-year-old Mongolia pine. Our study demonstrated the importance of separating autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration components of SR when stimulating the response of soil carbon efflux to environmental changes. When estimating the response of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration to environmental changes, the effect of forest type on age-related trends is required. ",

Three plantations of monoculture and mixed Pinus massoniana and Castanopsis hystrix were selected to examine soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and temporal and spatial patterns of the main greenhouse gases fluxes for understanding the effects of mixed forests on soil carbon and nitrogen (N) cycling processes. We found that SOC stock in 0-20Â cm layer in the mixed plantation was 14.3% higher than that in the P. massoniana, and 8.1% higher than that in the C. hystrix plantations. Differences in SOC stock among the plantations were attributed to soil N stock and leaf litterfall input. Soil CO2 and N2O fluxes in the mixed plantation displayed the seasonal trends, while soil CH4 flux did not show the seasonal trend. The seasonal variations in soil CO2 and N2O emissions were positively related to soil temperature and moisture. Mean soil CO2 and N2O emissions (53.2Â mgÂ CÂ m-2 h-1 and 5.21Â ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1, respectively) were significantly higher in the mixed plantation than in the P. massoniana plantation, while they were lower than in the C. hystrix plantation. Mean soil CH4 uptake (38.4Â ÂµgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1) was significantly higher in the mixed plantation than in the C. hystrix plantation, while it is similar to that in the P. massoniana plantation. Variations in soil CO2 flux among the plantations were influenced by fine root biomass, leaf litterfall mass, soil N stock and soil C:N ratio. Differences in soil N2O flux among the plantations could be attributed to the differences in soil N stock, soil NO3--N content and soil C:N ratio. Soil respiration rate and soil NO3--N content could account for variations in soil CH4 flux among the plantations. This study confirms that the mixed plantation has a higher SOC stock than the monoculture plantations, and there is an increase in amount of GHG absorbed by the soil of mixed plantations compared to C. hystrix plantations. Therefore, a mixture of C. hystrix versus P. massoniana, could be a better silvicultural approach for SOC sequestration than monoculture C. hystrix plantation for substituting P. massoniana plantations in subtropical China.",

Across China's temperate region, climatic changes and human activities have frequently caused the transformation of grasslands to woodlands. However, the effect of this transition on soil respiration and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics remains uncertain in this area. In this study, we measured in situ soil respiration and SOC storage over a two-year period (Jan. 2007-Dec. 2008) from five characteristic vegetation types in a forest-steppe ecotone of temperate China, including grassland (GR), shrubland (SH), as well as in evergreen coniferous (EC), deciduous coniferous (DC) and deciduous broadleaved forest (DB), to evaluate the changes of soil respiration and SOC storage with grassland conversions to diverse types of woodlands. Annual soil respiration increased by 3%, 6%, 14%, and 22% after the conversion from GR to EC, SH, DC, and DB, respectively. The variation in soil respiration among different vegetation types could be well explained by SOC and soil total nitrogen content. Despite higher soil respiration in woodlands, SOC storage and residence time increased in the upper 20 cm of soil. Our results suggest that the differences in soil environmental conditions, especially soil substrate availability, influenced the level of annual soil respiration produced by different vegetation types. Moreover, shifts from grassland to woody plant dominance resulted in increased SOC storage. Given the widespread increase in woody plant abundance caused by climate change and large-scale afforestation programs, the soils are expected to accumulate and store increased amounts of organic carbon in temperate areas of China.

The treatments studied included Control, application of bamboo leaf (Leaf), and application of biochar (Biochar). The Leaf treatment increased (P < 0.05) soil CO2 efflux and concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC). The Biochar treatment increased soil CO2 efflux and WSOC and MBC only in the first month after application, but such effects diminished thereafter. The annual cumulative soil CO2 emission was increased by 16Â % by the Leaf treatment as compared to the Control, but there was no difference between the Biochar and Control treatments. The soil organic C (SOC) storage was increased by biochar addition but not by bamboo leaf addition. An exponential relationship between soil temperature and soil CO2 efflux was observed regardless of the treatment. Soil CO2 efflux was correlated to soil WSOC (P < 0.05) but not to soil MBC or moisture content. The apparent temperature sensitivity (Q 10) of soil CO2 efflux was ranked as Leaf > Biochar > Control.

However, the effects of such changes on soil C cycling in subtropical forests remain largely unknown. In a typical subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest in Southwestern China we conducted a controlled experiment that included addition and removal of litter, and trenching. Annual soil respiration in control, trenching, litter addition, and litter removal treatments were 1083.47, 521.50, 1363.30, and 896.15 g C m-2 y-1, respectively. Soil respiration was significantly related to temperature in all treatments, but was independent of soil moisture, except in control plots. Q10 values in control, trenching, litter addition, and litter removal treatments were 3.46, 6.36, 2.72, and 4.85, respectively. Litter addition reduced Q10, but litter removal and trenching increased it. Average heterotrophic soil respiration produced C in the amount equivalent to 48% of the efflux from the soil. Soil respiration in the litter addition treatment was 25% higher than in the control treatment; this increase is about 8% larger than the 17% decrease in soil respiration caused by litter removal. This implies a priming effect on soil respiration. Our results suggest that increases in litter production in response to human disturbances and global warming could have rapid and important consequences on soil respiration in subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests.",

We examined patterns of soil CO2 efflux using five different methods: auto-chambers, portable gas analyzers, eddy covariance along and two models parameterized with the observed data. The relation between soil temperature and soil moisture with soil CO2 effluxes are also investigated, both inter-annually and seasonally, using these observations/results. Soil respiration rates (R soil) are greatest during the growing season when soil temperatures are between 15 and 25Â Â°C, but some soil CO2 efflux occurs throughout the year. Measured soil respiration was sensitive to soil temperature, particularly during the spring and fall. All measurement methods produced similar annual estimates. Depending on the time of the year, the eddy covariance (flux tower) estimate for ecosystem respiration is similar to or slightly lower than estimates of annual soil CO2 efflux from the other methods. As the eddy covariance estimate includes foliar and stem respiration which the other methods do not; it was expected to be larger (perhaps 15-30%). The auto-chamber system continuously measuring soil CO2 efflux rates provides a level of temporal resolution that permits investigation of short- to longer term influences of factors on these efflux rates. The expense of building and maintaining an auto chamber system may not be necessary for those researchers interested in estimating R soil annually, but auto-chambers do allow the capture of data from all seasons needed for model parameterization.",

Plots were established in three habitat types of lowland hill forest: two in mature tracts that differed in substrate type (talus vs non-talus), and a third in a 30-40Â year-old abandoned plantation on non-talus soil. We encountered a total of 57 tree species =10Â cm dbh. Richness was similar across sites, but composition differed substantially. We were able to classify with confidence 24 tree species into four distinct guilds based on forest-type preference: early successional or persistent successional (disturbed forest), generalist (no preference), or mature-phase. Sample size limitations or interactions between site age and substrate precluded categorization of all species. Thirty-eight percent (9/24) of the tree species were successional, a result which contrasts sharply with data from (formerly) continental forest in Panama. Spatial distributions of 33Â species revealed 17Â species exhibiting clumping or hyperdispersion (i.e., regular spacing) in at least one site. Possible non-anthropogenic mechanisms promoting clumping in the plots were (a)Â topography (edaphic), (b)Â gap affiliation, (c)Â inefficient or altered patterns of propagule dispersal, and (d)Â lack of natural seedling predators. Forest structure differed across site type, with stem densities highest in regenerating forest; conversely, regenerating forest had the lowest basal areas. Steep talus forest sequestered the most carbon (344.3Â MgÂ ha-1), and secondary forest sustained only 42% of levels found in talus forest (145.5Â MgÂ ha-1). Mature forest on non-talus soil sequestered the majority of carbon in mid-sized trees (30-50Â cmÂ dbh). Future assessments of land-use cover and biomass will provide for a complete estimate of the carbon budget of Tutuila. Finally, the results of this study suggest that conservation of the native fauna is essential in retaining the potential for regeneration of native forest after large-scale disturbance.",

Environmental conditions (soil temperature and soil moisture) explained the majority of variance in Rs. An exponential relationship in which the exponent is a polynomial expression that is linear with respect to temperature (Â°C) and quadratic with respect to moisture (% by volume) explained 57.0% of the variance in Rs (Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1).

This study highlighted the critical transition zone as major sites of Rs because of the synchronicity in optimal temperature and moisture conditions during the growing season and the large pool of high quality substrate that accumulates in topographic depositional areas.

Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem production (NEP) showed clear seasonality, with low rates during droughts and in winter. With statistical significance, the monthly GEP and RE increased exponentially with air temperature, but the monthly NEP was less sensitive and only increased linearly with air temperature.

Agroforestry systems, such as rubber plantations, are increasingly replacing primary and secondary forest systems in tropical Southwest China and thus effect the N2O emission in these regions on a landscape level. The mean N2O emission at site PF was 6.0Â Â±Â 0.1Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1. Fluxes of N2O increased from <5Â ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1 during dry season conditions to up to 24.5Â ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1 with re-wetting of the soil by the onset of first rainfall events. Comparable fluxes of N2O were measured in the SF and RP sites, where mean N2O emissions were 7.3Â Â±Â 0.7Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1 and 4.1Â Â±Â 0.5Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ NÂ m-2Â h-1, respectively. The dependency of N2O fluxes on soil moisture levels was demonstrated in a watering experiment, however, artificial rainfall only influenced the timing of N2O emission peaks, not the total amount of N2O emitted. For all sites, significant positive correlations existed between N2O emissions and both soil moisture and soil temperature. Mean CH4 uptake rates were highest at the PF site (-29.5Â Â±Â 0.3Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1), slightly lower at the SF site (-25.6Â Â±Â 1.3Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1) and lowest for the RP site (-5.7Â Â±Â 0.5Â SEÂ ÂµgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1). At all sites, CH4 uptake rates were negatively correlated with soil moisture, which was also reflected in the lower uptake rates measured in the watering experiment. In contrast to N2O emissions, CH4 uptake did not significantly correlate with soil temperature at the SF and RP sites, and only weakly correlated at the PF site. Over the 2Â month measurement period, CO2 emissions at the PF site increased significantly from 50Â mgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1 up to 100Â mgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1 (mean value 68.8Â Â±Â 0.8Â SEÂ mgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1), whereas CO2 emissions at the SF and RP site where quite stable and varied only slightly around mean values of 38.0Â Â±Â 1.8Â SEÂ mgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1 (SF) and 34.9Â Â±Â 1.1Â SEÂ mgÂ CÂ m-2Â h-1 (RP). A dependency of soil CO2 emissions on changes in soil water content could be demonstrated for all sites, thus, the watering experiment revealed significantly higher CO2 emissions as compared to control chambers. Correlation of CO2 emissions with soil temperature was significant at the PF site, but weak at the SF and not evident at the RP site. Even though we demonstrated that N and C trace gas fluxes significantly varied on subdaily and daily scales, weekly measurements would be sufficient if only the sink/ source strength of non-managed tropical forest sites needs to be identified.",

Given the intimate link between soil N availability and forest growth in this region, it is important to understand how temporal changes in soil N constrain the rate at which forest biomass accumulates following a stand-destroying disturbance. Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michx.) currently dominates sites where primarily old-growth pine-hemlock-oak forests once thrived, which provides an opportunity to observe nearly 100 years of succession following severe disturbance. In this study, we examine the relationship between soil N availability and biomass accrual in a series of plots undergoing secondary succession following logging and burning. Our results demonstrate that total aboveground biomass and nitrogen accrual patterns are strongly and positively related on a highly disturbed, bigtooth aspen-dominated ecosystem in northern Lower Michigan. Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification were highest immediately following disturbance, and then decreased over the next approximately 20 years of succession. Following this short-term decrease, these processes increased and attained a maximum value after 70 years of forest succession. Understory biomass accumulation showed the opposite trend of nutrient availability, with highest values during the first 20 years of succession, followed by a dramatic decrease for the next 70 years. Understory biomass began to decrease as plants grew into the overstory or died. Total aboveground biomass was correlated with N mineralization (r=0.894; P=0.041) and nitrification (r=0.782; P=0.118) and appears to be increasing steadily to some maximum that has not yet been reached.",

We measured soil respiration, net CO2 flux, and net CH4 flux during May-September 2003 and March 2004 in a black spruce lowland in interior Alaska to better understand how permafrost thaw in poorly drained landscapes affects land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange. Sites included peat soils underlain by permafrost at ~0.4 m depth (permafrost plateau, PP), four thermokarst wetlands (TW) having no permafrost in the upper 2.2 m, and peat soils bordering the thermokarst wetlands having permafrost at ~0.5 m depth (thermokarst edges, TE). Soil respiration rates were not significantly different among the sites, and 5-cm soil temperature explained 50-91% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration within the sites. Groundcover vegetation photosynthesis (calculated as net CO2 minus soil respiration) was significantly different among the sites (TW > TE > PP), which can be partly attributed to the difference in photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ground at each site type. Methane emission rates were 15 to 28 times greater from TW than from TE and PP. We modeled annual soil respiration and groundcover vegetation photosynthesis using soil temperature and radiation data, and CH4 flux by linear interpolation. We estimated all sites as net C gas sources to the atmosphere (not including tree CO2 uptake at PP and TE), although the ranges in estimates when accounting for errors were large enough that TE and TW may have been net C sinks.

To better understand the role of soil drainage class in carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and decomposition, we measured soil respiration and net CO2 fluxes, litter decomposition and litterfall rates, and SOC stocks above permafrost in three Alaska black spruce forest stands characterized as well drained (WD), moderately drained (MD), and poorly drained (PD). Soil respiration and net CO2 fluxes were not significantly different among sites, although the relation between soil respiration rate and temperature varied with site (Q10: WDÂ > MDÂ > PD). Annual estimated soil respiration, litter decomposition, and groundcover photosynthesis were greatest at PD. These results suggest that soil temperature and moisture conditions in shallow organic horizon soils at PD were more favorable for decomposition compared with the better drained sites. SOC stocks, however, increase from WD to MD to PD such that surface decomposition and C storage are diametric. Greater groundcover vegetation productivity, protection of deep SOC by permafrost and anoxic conditions, and differences in fire return interval and (or) severity at PD counteract the relatively high near-surface decomposition rates, resulting in high net C accumulation.",

Our starting point was a fine-scale, multilayer model of half-hourly canopy processes that has been parametrized for Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Over varied growing season conditions, this fine-scale model predicted hourly carbon and latent energy fluxes that were in good agreement with data from eddy covariance studies. Using an heuristic process, we derived a simple aggregated set of equations operating on cumulative or average values of the most sensitive driving variables (leaf area index, mean foliar N concentration, canopy height, average daily temperature and temperature range, atmospheric transmittance, latitude, day of year, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and an index of soil moisture). We calibrated the aggregated model to provide estimates of GPP similar to those of the fine-scale model across a wide range of these driving variables. Our calibration across this broad range of conditions captured 96% of fine-scale model behavior, but was computationally many orders of magnitude faster. We then tested the assumptions we had made in generating the aggregated model by applying it in different ecosystems. Using the same parameter values derived for Harvard Forest, the aggregated model made sound predictions of GPP for wet-sedge tundra in the Arctic under a variety of experimental manipulations, and also for a range of forest types across the OTTER (Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research) transect in Oregon, running from coastal Sitka spruce to high-plateau mountain juniper.

However, these data may be patchy, and have gaps or biases. An alternative approach to generating C budgets has been to use process-based models, constructed to simulate the key processes involved in C exchange. However, the process of model building is arguably subjective, and parameters may be poorly defined. This paper demonstrates why data assimilation (DA) techniques - which combine stock and flux observations with a dynamic model - improve estimates of, and provide insights into, ecosystem carbon (C) exchanges. We use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to link a series of measurements with a simple box model of C transformations. Measurements were collected at a young ponderosa pine stand in central Oregon over a 3-year period, and include eddy flux and soil CO2 efflux data, litterfall collections, stem surveys, root and soil cores, and leaf area index data. The simple C model is a mass balance model with nine unknown parameters, tracking changes in C storage among five pools; foliar, wood and fine root pools in vegetation, and also fresh litter and soil organic matter (SOM) plus coarse woody debris pools. We nested the EnKF within an optimization routine to generate estimates from the data of the unknown parameters and the five initial conditions for the pools. The efficacy of the DA process can be judged by comparing the probability distributions of estimates produced with the EnKF analysis vs. those produced with reduced data or model alone. Using the model alone, estimated net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE)=-251Â±197 g C m-2 over the 3 years, compared with an estimate of -419Â±29 g C m-2 when all observations were assimilated into the model. The uncertainty on daily measurements of NEE via eddy fluxes was estimated at 0.5 g C m-2 day-1, but the uncertainty on assimilated estimates averaged 0.47 g C m-2 day-1, and only exceeded 0.5 g C m-2 day-1 on days where neither eddy flux nor soil efflux data were available. In generating C budgets, the assimilation process reduced the uncertainties associated with using data or model alone and the forecasts of NEE were statistically unbiased estimates. The results of the analysis emphasize the importance of time series as constraints. Occasional, rare measurements of stocks have limited use in constraining the estimates of other components of the C cycle. Long time series are particularly crucial for improving the analysis of pools with long time constants, such as SOM, woody biomass, and woody debris. Long-running forest stem surveys, and tree ring data, offer a rich resource that could be assimilated to provide an important constraint on C cycling of slow pools. For extending estimates of NEE across regions, DA can play a further important role, by assimilating remote-sensing data into the analysis of C cycles. We show, via sensitivity analysis, how assimilating an estimate of photosynthesis - which might be provided indirectly by remotely sensed data - improves the analysis of NEE. ",

Therefore, although eddy covariance data can be invaluable, additional tools such as empirical gap-filling methods, independent measurements of CO2 flux using chambers, and simulations using canopy process models are often necessary to obtain reliable annual carbon uptake estimates. Two independent approaches for estimating annual NEE using these tools at the Walker Branch site are discussed. One approach is to cumulatively sum the full set of eddy covariance measurements over time. The second approach is to sum the output of NEE from a biophysical canopy exchange model (CANOAK). CANOAK incorporates independent chamber measurements on leaves, soil, and stems and is driven using the observed canopy architecture, meteorology, soil water content, and soil temperatures to predict NEE. Both methods estimate similar trends and magnitudes of daytime (daylight hours) soil respiration and NEE over 5 years. Both methods also suggest similar differences among years (interannual variability). These two estimates of NEE are used to address possible measurement bias errors at this site and to provide plausible estimates of annual NEE. The estimated mean annual NEE at this site is -574 g C m-2 yr-1 between 1995 and 1999, ranging from -470 g C m-2 y-1 (1995) to -629 g C m-2 yr-1 (1999) (negative NEE indicates uptake by forest). ",

The stands of the â€œlichenâ€ site type (LT) were stratified into three chronosequences according to stand density and fire history. Allometric equations were established from 90 sample trees for stem, coarse branch, fine branch, twig and needle biomass. The LT stands exhibited a low but sustained biomass accumulation until a stand age of 383 years. AGB reached only 6-10 kgdw m-2 after 200 years depending on stand density and fire history compared to 20 kgdw m-2 in the â€œVacciniumâ€ type (VT) stands. Leaf area index (LAI) in the LT stands remained at 0.5-1.5 and crown cover was 30-60%, whereas LAI reached 2.5 and crown cover was >100% in the VT stands. Although nearest-neighbour analyses suggested the existence of density-dependent mortality, fire impact turned out to have a much stronger effect on density dynamics. Fire scar dating and calculation of mean and initial fire return intervals revealed that within the LT stands differences in structure and biomass were related to the severity of fire regimes, which in turn was related to the degree of landscape fragmentation by wetlands. Self-thinning analysis was used to define the local carrying capacity for biomass. A series of undisturbed LT stands was used to characterise the upper self-thinning boundary. Stands that had experienced a moderate fire regime were positioned well below the self-thinning boundary in a distinct fire-thinning band of reduced major axis regression slope -0.26. We discuss how this downward shift resulted from alternating phases of density reduction by fire and subsequent regrowth. We conclude that biomass in Siberian Scots pine forests is strongly influenced by fire and that climate change will affect ecosystem functions predominantly via changes in fire regimes.",

NEPC quantifies changes in carbon pools along the chronosequences, whereas NEPS estimates the short-term stand-level carbon balance in intervals between fires. The chronosequences differed in the mean return interval of surface fires (unburned or moderately burned, 40 yr; heavily burned, 25 yr) and site quality (lichen versus Vaccinium type). Of the Vaccinium type (higher site quality) only a moderately burned chronosequence was studied.NEPC was derived from the rate of changes of two major carbon pools along the chronosequence time axes: (1) decomposition of old coarse woody debris (CWD) left from the previous generation after stand-replacing fire, and (2) accumulation of new carbon in biomass, CWD and soil organic layer by the regenerating stand. Young stands of all chronosequences were losing carbon at rates of-4 to -19 mol C m-2 yr-1(-48 to -228 g C m-2 yr-1). Depending on initial CWD pools and site-specific accumulation rates the stands became net carbon sinks after 12 yr (Vaccinium type) to 24 yr (lichen type) following the stand-replacing fire and offset initial carbon losses after 27 and 70 yr, respectively. Highest NEPC was reached in the unburned chronosequence (10.8 mol C m-2 yr-1 or 130 g C m-2 yr-1). Maximum NEPC in the burned chronosequences ranged from 1.8 to 5.1 mol C m-2 yr-1 (22 to 61 g C m-2 yr-1) depending on site quality and fire regime. Around a stand age of 200 yr NEPC was 1.6 Â± 0.6 mol C m-2 yr-1 (19 Â± 7 g C m-2 yr-1) across all chronosequences. NEPS represents the current stand-level carbon accumulation in intervals between recurring surface fires and can be viewed as a mass-based analogue of net ecosystem exchange measured with flux towers. It was estimated based on measurements of current woody NPP, modelled decomposition of measured CWD pools and organic layer accumulation as a function of time since the last surface fire, but ignores carbon dynamics in the mineral soil. In burned mature lichen type stands, NEPS was 6.2 Â± 2.6 mol C m-2 yr-1 (74 Â± 31 g C m-2 yr-1) and thus five times higher than NEPC at the respective age (1.2 Â± 0.6 mol C m-2 yr-1 or 14 Â± 7 g C m-2 yr-1). Comparing NEPS and NEPC of mature stands, we estimate that 48% of NPP are consumed by heterotrophic respiration and additional 35% are consumed by recurrent surface fires. As expected, in unburned stands NEPC and NEPS were of similar magnitude. Exploring a site specific model of CWD production and decomposition we estimated that fire reduces the carbon pool of newly produced CWD by 70%. Direct observation revealed that surface fire events consume 50% of the soil organic layer carbon pool (excluding CWD). We conclude that surface fires strongly reduced NEPC. In ecosystems with frequent fire events direct flux measurements using eddy covariance are likely to record high rates of carbon uptake, since they describe the behaviour of ecosystems recovering from fire without capturing the sporadic but substantial fire-related carbon losses.",

These differed in the mean return interval of surface fires (unburned - moderately burned, 40 years - heavily burned, 25 years) and site quality (lichen versus Vaccinium site type). Of the Vaccinium site type (higher site quality) only a moderately burned chronosequence was studied. A total of 22 even-aged stands were investigated with stand ages ranging from 2 to 383 years. The C balance was dominated by the opposing dynamics of coarse woody debris (CWD) and biomass and could be divided into three phases: (1) Young stands (up to 40 years)acted as a net source for C of 6-10 mol C m-2 year-1 because the previous generation CWD pool originating from stand-replacing crown fires decayed much faster than biomass increased. During this period the C pool in the unburned lichen type chronosequence decreased from 807 to 480 mol C m-2. (2) Middle aged stands (40-100 years) being in a stage of maximum biomass accumulation were a net sink of 8-10 mol C m-2 year-1. (3)Maturestands (100 to > 350 years) continued to sequester C at a lower rate (0.8-2.5mol C m-2 year-1). Differences in the rates of C sequestration during the two later phases could be explained by the complex interaction between surface fire regime and site type. Recurrent surface fires resulted in enhanced mortality and regularly redistributed C from the living to the CWD pool thereby lowering the rate of C sequestration. Site quality determined the potential to recover from disturbance by fire events. Differences in site type did not correlate with soil and total ecosystem N pool size. However, the N status of needles as well as the N pool of physiologically active tissue was highest in the stands of the Vaccinium type. The â€œwoodyâ€ C pool (biomass + CWD) was sensitive to differences in surface fire regime and site type. It was lowest in the heavily burned lichen type chronosequence (297 Â± 108 mol C m-2), intermediate in the unburned and moderately burned lichen type chronosequence (571 Â± 179 mol C m-2) and highest in the moderately burned Vaccinium type chronosequence (810 Â± 334 mol C m-2). In contrast, the total soil C pool (organic plus mineral layer down to a depth of 25 cm) was independent of stand age, surface fire regimeand site type and fluctuated around a value of 250 mol C m-2. The organic layer C pool oscillated in response to recurring surface fires and its C pool was dependent on time since fire increasing at a rate of about 1.5 mol C m-2 year-during the first 40 years and then reaching a plateau of 170 mol C m-2. The total ecosystem N pool was 7.4 Â± 1.5 mol N m-2 on average of which only 25 % were stored in biomass or coarse woody debris. Total ecosystem N was independent of stand age, surface fire regime and site type. No correlation was found between total ecosystem C and N pools. Average total ecosystem C:N ratio was 114 Â± 35 mol C mol N-1. A conceptual model illustrating how changes in the regime of stand-replacing crown fires and recurrent surface fires and changes in site quality interact in determining the long-term C balance in Siberian Scots pine forests is presented.",

In this investigation, we examined in detail how soil CO2 efflux differs both spatially and temporally with respect to stand age for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations on the Virginia Piedmont. Throughout a 12-month period, efflux rates were measured both near the base of trees and midway between planting rows in stands of four age classes. Mean soil CO2 efflux rates measured during the 12-month study were 1.72, 2.58, 2.84, and 2.90Â Âµmol/m2/s for 1- to 2-year-old, 4- to 6-year-old, 8- to 12-year-old, and 20- to 25-year-old stands, respectively. Time series analysis revealed that stand age had a significant effect on soil CO2 efflux rate. Additionally, mean efflux rates were consistently higher near the tree and time series analysis revealed that measurement position had a significant effect on soil CO2 efflux rate. Mean soil CO2 efflux rates, by position, for the 12-month study were 2.72 and 2.28Â Âµmol/m2/s for the near and away measurement positions, respectively. Regression analysis was used to examine the influence of soil and climatic factors on seasonal changes in soil CO2 efflux. The most influential factors affecting soil CO2 efflux during the 12-month study were soil temperature, soil moisture, stand age, and measurement position. We believe respiring roots significantly influence soil CO2 efflux of plantation loblolly pine and account for differences observed between stands of different ages as well as spatial differences observed within a given stand.",

The annual soil respiration was 1017Â gCÂ m-2, which accounted for 76% of the total ecosystem respiration.

A more reasonable method to calculate Q10 values of soil based on weighted mean respiratory contribution rates of temperature in each layer was suggested. There was moderate correlation between soil respiration rates and volumetric soil water content. Very dry or very wet soil generally depressed the soil respiration. However, when soil temperature increased, the wet forest soil (WsÂ >Â 0.35Â m3Â m-3) had greater respiratory potential.

Soil CO2 efflux, soil temperature, and soil water content were measured once a month over two years. Soil respiration was divided into four components: the decomposition of basic soil organic matter (SOM), litter respiration, root respiration, and the interaction effect between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity. A two-factor regression equation was used to correct the value of soil CO2 efflux.ResultsWe found a significant effect of the interaction between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity (R INT) on total soil respiration, and R INT exhibited significant seasonal variation, accounting for 26 and 31Â % of total soil respiration in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. However, we found no significant interaction effect on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. The temperature sensitivity was significantly increased by trenching compared with the control, but was unchanged by litter removal.ConclusionsThough the interaction between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity had no effects on temperature sensitivity, it had a significant positive effect on soil respiration. Our results not only showed strong influence of rhizosphere activity on temperature sensitivity, but provided a viable way to identify the contribution of SOM to soil respiration, which could help researchers gain insights on the carbon cycle.",

Total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) was assessed using soil CO2 effluxes and aboveground litterfall. Additionally, CO2 production of organic layers was examined over 10Â months under constant conditions in an incubation experiment.ResultsAnnual soil CO2 effluxes were not different among the forest sites, but predicted effluxes at a given temperature of 10Â°C revealed some significant differences and correlated with the phosphorous stock of the organic layers. The incubation study indicated 50% faster decomposition of organic layers from deciduous than from coniferous forests. TBCA related to soil CO2 efflux was smaller in the deciduous than in the coniferous forests. The ratio of TBCA to soil CO2 efflux was positively correlated with the C stock of organic layers.ConclusionsOur results suggest that marked differences in site characteristics have little impact on soil CO2 effluxes at the regional scale, but the contribution of soil CO2 sources varies among the forest types.",

Across the experimental period, the mean total soil respiration and litter respiration were 1.94 and 0.81, 2.00 and 0.60, 2.19 and 0.71 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1, and the litter dry mass remaining was 57.6%, 56.2% and 61.3% in the 20-, 30-, and 46-year-old forests, respectively. We found that the temporal variations of soil respiration and litter decomposition rates can be well explained by soil temperature at 5 cm depth. Both the total soil respiration and litter respiration were significantly positively correlated with the litter decomposition rates. The mean contribution of the litter respiration to the total soil respiration was 31.0%-45.9% for the three different-aged forests. The present study found that the total soil respiration was not significantly affected by forest age when P. masonniana stands exceed a certain age (e.g. >20 years old), but it increased significantly with increased soil temperature. Hence, forest management strategies need to protect the understory vegetation to limit soil warming, in order to reduce the CO2 emission under the currently rapid global warming. The contribution of litter decomposition to the total soil respiration varies across spatial and temporal scales. This indicates the need for separate consideration of soil and litter respiration when assessing the climate impacts on forest carbon cycling. ",

To address this issue, fluxes of CO2 (Fc, flux toward the surface is negative) were measured over a Mediterranean, annual grassland in California, USA for 2 years with the eddy covariance method.To interpret the biotic and abiotic factors that modulate Fc over the course of a year we decomposed net ecosystem CO2 exchange into its constituent components, ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP). Daytime Reco was extrapolated from the relationship between temperature and nighttime Fc under high turbulent conditions. Then, GPP was estimated by subtracting daytime values of Fc from daytime estimates of Reco.Results show that most of carbon exchange, both photosynthesis and respiration, was limited to the wet season (typically from October to mid-May). Seasonal variations in GPP followed closely to changes in leaf area index, which in turn was governed by soil moisture, available sunlight and the timing of the last frost. In general, Reco was an exponential function of soil temperature, but with season-dependent values of Q10. The temperature-dependent respiration model failed immediately after rain events, when large pulses of Reco were observed. Respiration pulses were especially notable during the dry season when the grass was dead and were the consequence of quickly stimulated microbial activity.Integrated values of GPP, Reco, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were 867, 735, and -132Â gÂ CÂ m-2, respectively, for the 2000-2001 season, and 729, 758, and 29Â gÂ CÂ m-2 for the 2001-2002 season. Thus, the grassland was a moderate carbon sink during the first season and a weak carbon source during the second season. In contrast to a well-accepted view that annual production of grass is linearly correlated to precipitation, the large difference in GPP between the two seasons were not caused by the annual precipitation. Instead, a shorter growing season, due to late start of the rainy season, was mainly responsible for the lower GPP in the second season. Furthermore, relatively higher Reco during the non-growing season occurred after a late spring rain. Thus, for this Mediterranean grassland, the timing of rain events had more impact than the total amount of precipitation on ecosystem GPP and NEE. This is because its growing season is in the cool and wet season when carbon uptake and respiration are usually limited by low temperature and sometimes frost, not by soil moisture.",

Age-related reductions in stand biomass accumulation are frequently observed in old-growth forests. The phenomenon may be caused by reduced production, increased mortality or both. The relative importance of production and mortality is not well studied, so the mechanisms controlling age-related decline of stand biomass accumulation remain unclear. 2. In this study, conducted in a Quercus-dominated deciduous forest in the Northeastern USA, we examined whether age-related decline in stand above-ground biomass (AGB) accumulation could be explained by reduction of above-ground net primary production (NPP) (growth of surviving trees) that may be associated with (i) physiological constraints within individual trees or (ii) changes in stand structure, or by (iii) age-related, increasing tree mortality in stands up to 135 years old. Few previous studies have tested these hypotheses simultaneously within the same forest. 3. We did not find evidence for a reduction in individual tree growth associated with age-related physiological constraints, in terms of foliar carbon assimilation capacity, photosynthesis/respiration balance, nitrogen availability or hydraulic constraints on carbon gain. Over the period of 1937-2006, we did not observe alterations in stand structure, and the above-ground NPP of the Quercus forest was generally stable. 4. However, we did find that the primary mechanism driving age-related decline of stand AGB accumulation was biomass loss due to the death of large, dominant trees. Our results indicate that shifts in mortality from the loss of small trees to the loss of large trees, rather than changes in above-ground NPP, drives age-related decline in stand AGB accumulation in this forest. 5. Synthesis. We found that within the range of stand development stages analysed, the age-related decline of stand AGB accumulation in a Quercus-dominated forest was primarily due to mortality of large, dominant trees and not due to changes in above-ground NPP associated with tree physiology, individual tree growth or stand structure. This result indicates that tree demography and the influence of climate change on disturbances may need to be integrated into models to predict the change of above-ground carbon stock of some old-growth forests.

However, little is known about winter soil respiration on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. We therefore measured winter soil CO2 fluxes and estimated annual soil respiration in two contrasting coniferous forest ecosystems (a Picea asperata plantation and a natural forest). Mean winter soil CO2 effluxes were 1.08Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the plantation and 1.16Â ÂµmolÂ m-2Â s-1 in the natural forest. These values are higher than most reported winter soil CO2 efflux values for temperate or boreal forest ecosystems. Winter soil respiration rates were similar for our two forest ecosystems but mean soil CO2 efflux over the growing season was higher in the natural forest than in the plantation. The estimated winter and annual soil effluxes for the natural forest were 176.3 and 1070.3Â gÂ m-2, respectively, based on the relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature, which were 17.2 and 9.7Â % greater than their counterparts in the plantation. The contributions of winter soil respiration to annual soil efflux were 15.4Â % for the plantation and 16.5Â % for the natural forest and were statistically similar. Our results indicate that winter soil CO2 efflux from frozen soils in the alpine coniferous forest ecosystems of the eastern Tibetan Plateau was considerable and was an important component of annual soil respiration. Moreover, reforestation (natural coniferous forests were deforested and reforested with P. asperata plantation) may reduce soil respiration by reducing soil carbon substrate availability and input.",

Fluxes of CO2 CH4 and N2O from the soil were monitored over a 2-yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO2 and CH4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N2O were low and no significant differences were observed between the treatments. Annual CH4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP < uDP < uDuP < n-pris with mean annual effluxes over the 2-yr monitoring period of 0.15, 0.64, 7.70 and 22.63 g CH4 m-2 yr-1, respectively. For CO2, effluxes increased in the order uDP < DP< n-pris < uDuP, with mean annual effluxes of 1.23, 1.66, 1.82 and 2.55 kg CO2 m-2 yr-1, respectively. CO2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76-98%), and only in the n-pris site was CH4 a substantial contribution (23%). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43% higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33% higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH4 emissions, but reduce CO2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees.

The differences among the five study years were the annual precipitation (320.1, 370.5, 508.8, 341.6, and 567.4 mm in 2005-2009, respectively) and annual distribution. The results showed that the seasonal change of soil respiration in both vegetation types was similar and controlled by soil temperature and soil water content. The mean soil respiration across 5 years in the forest (3.78 Â± 2.68 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1) was less than that in the grassland (4.04 Â± 3.06 Âµmol CO2 m-2 s-1), and the difference was significant. The drought soil in summer depressed soil respiration substantially. The Q10 value across 5-year measurements was 2.89 and 2.94 for forest and grassland. When soil water content was between wilting point (WP) and field capacity (FC), the Q10 in both types increased with increasing soil water content, and when soil water content dropped to below WP, soil respiration and the Q10 decreased substantially. Although an exponential model was well fitted to predict the annual mean soil respiration for each single year data, it overestimated and underestimated soil respiration, respectively, in drought conditions and after rain for short periods of time during the year. The two-variable models including temperature and water content variables could be well used to predict soil respiration for both types in all weather conditions. The models proposed are useful for understanding and predicting potential changes in the eastern part of Loess plateau in response to climate change. ",

In this study, we conducted an aboveground litter manipulation experiment to examine the influence of litter addition and exclusion on soil FCO2 in Camphor tree, Masson pine, and mixed Camphor tree and Masson pine forests in central south China. Litter input manipulation included three treatments: non-litter input (litter exclusion), double litter input (litter addition), and natural litter input (control). On average, litter exclusion significantly reduced soil FCO2 rate by approximately 39%, 24% and 22% in Camphor tree forests, the Mixed forests, and Masson pine forests, respectively. On a yearly basis, double litter addition significantly increased soil CO2 by 12% in the Mixed forests (P=0.02) but not in both Camphor tree and Masson pine forests (P>0.05), when compared with their corresponding control treatments. However, litter addition increased soil FCO2 rates in the months of June-August in Camphor tree and Masson pine forests, coinciding with high soil temperature of summer conditions. Litter exclusion reduced soil FCO2 more than litter addition increased it in the study sites. Responses of soil respiration to litter input treatments varied with forest types. Litter input treatments did not alter the seasonal patterns of soil temperature and soil water content. Our results indicated that changes in aboveground litter as a result of global climate change and/or forest management have a great potential to alter soil respiration and soil carbon balance in forest ecosystems.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vegetation type on soil respiration, temperature and water content, and their correlations on a small scale. We measured soil respiration rate (Rs) over a 3-year period at biweekly intervals in three plots in the eastern Loess Plateau of China, with the same soil texture but different vegetation types: pine forest, grassland, and shrub land. Simultaneously, soil temperature (Ts) at 10Â cm depth and soil water content (Ws) within 10Â cm depth were measured. The seasonal course of Rs and Ts showed a similar temporal variation in the three plots, with higher values in summer and autumn and lower values in winter and spring. No significant differences (P>0.05) were found between plots, except for Ws. The mean cumulative release of CO2 efflux from March to December was 962.5, 1027.5, and 1166.5Â gÂ CÂ m-Â 2Â a-Â 1 for plots 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with no significant difference between plots. The fitted exponential equations of Rs versus Ts from the 3-year data-set were significant (PÂ <Â 0.05) with an R2 of 0.72, 0.64, and 0.72 for plots 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The calculated Q10 from the parameters of the fitted equation was 3.57, 3.52, and 3.61, and the R10 was 2.36, 2.03, and 2.37Â ÂµmolÂ CO2Â m-Â 2Â s-Â 1 for plots 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Compared with the Ts, the correlations between Rs and Ws were not significant for the three plots. However, if the Ts was above 10Â°C, then their correlation was significant, and Ws had an impact on Rs. Four combined regression equations including two variables of Ts and Ws could be well established to model correlations between Rs and both Ts and Ws. Our study demonstrated that the exponential and power model fitted best and no significant different correlations of combined equations existed between the three plots. These results show that vegetation type had little impact on Rs, Ts, Ws, and their correlations, as well as on related parameters such as Q10 and R10. Therefore, while doing Rs research in a horizontal patchy vegetation conditions on a small area, the sampling location of measurements should focus on vertical dominant vegetation and ignore patch vegetation so as to reduce field work load.",

The present study estimated the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) for an old-growth subtropical forest at the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve in South China to investigate the temporal pattern of carbon sequestration, both seasonally and annually. The measured NEP over 7 years (from 2003 to 2009) showed that this forest was a net carbon sink, ranging from 230 (in 2008) to 489...-2 year-1 (in 2004). The greatest value of NEP was found in the driest year and the lowest value in the wettest year during the study period. Within a year, NEP during the dry season was about 81.4 % higher than for the wet season. Accordingly, the dry season at seasonal scale and dry years at interannual scale are key periods for carbon sequestration in this forest. The strong seasonality of ecosystem or soil respiration (ER or SR) compared with gross primary productivity (GPP) resulted in substantial amounts of carbon being sequestered during dry seasons. A decrease of GPP and an increase of ER or SR demonstrated the lower carbon uptake in rainy years. From this study, we conclude that GPP and living biomass carbon increment are not overriding parameters controlling NEP. The variations in ER or SR driven by the rainfall scheme were the dominant factor determining the magnitude of NEP in this forest in South China.",

We used quantitative soil pits to describe rooting patterns with soil depth and distance to trees in northern hardwood stands. We sited three 0.5 m2 quantitative soil pits in each of three young (19<U+0096>27 years) and three older (56<U+0096>69 years) stands developed after clear-cutting. Live roots were divided into diameter classes delimited at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 100 mm; dead roots were not distinguished by size. Mean total live-root biomass was 2900 Â± 500 gÂ·m<U+0096>2 in older stands and 1500 Â± 400 gÂ·m<U+0096>2 in young stands. The root mass in the 2<U+0096>20 mm class was 2.7 times greater in the older stands (p = 0.03); fine-root (<2 mm) biomass was 1.5 times greater (p = 0.12), suggesting that fine-root biomass continues to increase past the age of canopy closure in this forest type. Root biomass density declined with soil depth, with the finest roots (<0.5 mm) declining most steeply; roots were found at low densities well into the C horizon. We analyzed root biomass density as a function of the influence of nearby trees (represented as the sum of basal area divided by the distance from the pit) and found that fine as well as coarse roots reflected this influence. In systems where this is the case, root measurements should be made with attention to patterns of tree distribution.",

Hayata (CAC) and Pinus massoniana D. Don (PIM), and compared with that of an adjacent 29-year-old plantation of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb.) (CUL) in Jianou, Fujian, China. Mean annual total litterfall over 3 years of observations varied from 4.63 Mg ha-1 in the CUL to 8.85 Mg ha-1 in the PIM; of this litterfall, the leaf contribution ranged from 62 to 73 per cent. Litterfall in the CAF, ALG and CAC showed an unimodal distribution pattern, while for the five other forests, the litterfall pattern was multi-peak. The rank order of the eight forests, according to nutrient return mass with the exception of P, was different from the order when rank was according to total mass of litterfall. The highest annual N, K and Ca returns from total litterfall were noticed in the TSO, the CAF and the CUL, respectively. The amounts of P and Mg potentially returned to the soil were the highest in the PIM. The leaf fraction provided greater potential returns of N, P, K, Ca and Mg to the soil than other litter fractions. The results of this study demonstrate that natural forests have a greater capability for maintaining site productivity than the monoculture coniferous plantation, due to higher amount of above-ground litter coupled with greater nutrient returns; therefore conservation of natural forests is recommended as a practical measure in forest management to realize sustainable development of forestry in mountainous areas of southern China.",

Biomass carbon increment of aboveground parts and coarse roots were measured by the allometric method. Above- and belowground litter C inputs were assessed by litter traps and sequential cores, respectively. Soil respiration (SR) was determined by the alkaline absorbance method, and the contribution from roots, above- and belowground litters was separated by the DIRT plots. Annual SR averaged 13.742Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â a-1 in the NF, 9.439Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â a-1 in the CK, and 4.543Â t CÂ ha-1Â a-1 in the CF.

The community biomass of the 52-year-old S. superba-C. carlesii forests in this study was lower than the average biomass of subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests in China, and was lower than the biomass of other subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests elsewhere in the world. Moreover, its productivity was lower than the model estimate, indicating that without disturbance, this community has great developmental potential in terms of community biomass and productivity.",

We conducted a biometric estimate of net ecosystem production (NEP) in a mature Japanese cedar plantation beneath a flux tower over a 4-year period. Net primary production (NPP) was 7.9Â MgÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1 and consisted mainly of tree biomass increment and aboveground litter production.

In agreement with the tower-based flux findings, this result suggests that the Japanese cedar plantation was a strong carbon sink. The biometric-based NEP was higher among most other types of Japanese forests studied. Carbon sequestration in the mature plantation was characterized by a larger increment in tree biomass and lower mortality than in natural forests. Land-use change from natural forest to Japanese cedar plantation might, therefore, stimulate carbon sequestration and change the carbon allocation of NPP from an increment in coarse woody debris to an increase in tree biomass.",

Separating the effects of these factors is critical to understand the belowground carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. In Ethiopia with its unreliable seasonal rainfall, variability of soil CO2 efflux may be particularly associated with seasonal variation. In this study, soil respiration was measured in nine plots under the canopies of three indigenous trees (Croton macrostachys, Podocarpus falcatus and Prunus africana) growing in an Afromontane forest of south-eastern Ethiopia. Our objectives were to investigate seasonal and diurnal variation in soil CO2 flux rate as a function of soil temperature and soil moisture, and to investigate the impact of tree species composition on soil respiration. Results showed that soil respiration displayed strong seasonal patterns, being lower during dry periods and higher during wet periods. The dependence of soil respiration on soil moisture under the three tree species explained about 50% of the seasonal variability. The relation followed a Gaussian function, and indicated a decrease in soil respiration at soil volumetric water contents exceeding a threshold of about 30%. Under more moist conditions soil respiration is tentatively limited by low oxygen supply. On a diurnal basis temperature dependency was observed, but not during dry periods when plant and soil microbial activities were restrained by moisture deficiency. Tree species influenced soil respiration, and there was a significant interaction effect of tree species and soil moisture on soil CO2 efflux variability. During wet (and cloudy) period, when shade tolerant late successional P. falcatus is having a physiological advantage, soil respiration under this tree species exceeded that under the other two species. In contrast, soil CO2 efflux rates under light demanding pioneer C. macrostachys appeared to be least sensitive to dry (but sunny) conditions. This is probably related to the relatively higher carbon assimilation rates and associated root respiration. We conclude that besides the anticipated changes in precipitation pattern in Ethiopia any anthropogenic disturbance fostering the pioneer species may alter the future ecosystem carbon balance by its impact on soil respiration.",

The Q 10 value in the study period was always smaller for GS than DS, suggesting that soil carbon cycling may be more sensitive to the temperature changes at low than at high temperature range. These results indicated that climate changes may have great potential impacts on temperate Larch plantations in Northeast China, owing to soil carbon emissions of Larch plantation during the long period of DS being more sensitive to T 10 than in GS, and played a significant role in the annual forest ecosystems carbon budget.",

However, studies on soil respiration in these plantation forests are rather scarce and their soil carbon flux remains an uncertainty. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure soil surface flux of a 50-year-old mature plantation of Platycladus orientalis at Jiufeng Mountain, Beijing, China. Mean daily soil respiration rates (Rs) ranged from 0.09 to 4.87 Âµmol CO2 m-2s-1, with the highest values observed in August and the lowest in the winter months. A logistic model gave the best fit to the relationship between hourly Rs and soil temperature (Ts), explaining 82% of the variation in Rs over the annual cycle. The annual total of soil respiration estimated from the logistic model was 645Â±5 g C m-2 year-1. The performance of the logistic model was poorest during periods of high soil temperature or low soil volumetric water content (VWC), which limits the model's ability to predict the seasonal dynamics of Rs. The logistic model will potentially overestimate Rs at high Ts and low VWC. Seasonally, Rs increased significantly and linearly with increasing VWC in May and July, in which VWC was low. In the months from August to November, inclusive, in which VWC was not limiting, Rs showed a positively exponential relationship with Ts. The seasonal sensitivity of soil respiration to Ts (Q10) ranged from 0.76 in May to 4.38 in October. It was suggested that soil temperature was the main determinant of soil respiration when soil water was not limiting. ",

In this study, we quantified the carbon fluxes in different terrestrial ecosystems in China, and analyzed their spatial variation and environmental drivers based on the long-term observation data of ChinaFLUX sites and the published data from other flux sites in China. The results indicate that gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of terrestrial ecosystems in China showed a significantly latitudinal pattern, declining linearly with the increase of latitude. However, GEP, ER, and NEP did not present a clear longitudinal pattern. The carbon sink functional areas of terrestrial ecosystems in China were mainly located in the subtropical and temperate forests, coastal wetlands in eastern China, the temperate meadow steppe in the northeast China, and the alpine meadow in eastern edge of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The forest ecosystems had stronger carbon sink than grassland ecosystems. The spatial patterns of GEP and ER in China were mainly determined by mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT), whereas the spatial variation in NEP was largely explained by MAT. The combined effects of MAT and MAP explained 79%, 62%, and 66% of the spatial variations in GEP, ER, and NEP, respectively. The GEP, ER, and NEP in different ecosystems in China exhibited â€˜positive coupling correlation' in their spatial patterns. Both ER and NEP were significantly correlated with GEP, with 68% of the per-unit GEP contributed to ER and 29% to NEP. MAT and MAP affected the spatial patterns of ER and NEP mainly by their direct effects on the spatial pattern of GEP. ",

In this research we investigated soil organic carbon density, litter production, litter decomposition rate, soil respiration, and soil microbial properties in a chronosequence of four Chinese fir plantations of 7, 16, 23 and 29 years at Dagangshan mountain range, Jiangxi Province, south China. There was a significant increasing trend in litter production with increasing plantation age. Litter decomposition rate and soil respiration, however, declined from the 7-year to the 16-year plantation, and then increased after 16 years. This was largely dependent on soil microorganisms. Soil carbon output was higher than carbon input before 16 years, and total soil carbon stock declined from 35.98 tÂ·ha-1 in the 7-year plantation to 30.12 tÂ·ha-1 in the 16-year plantation. Greater litter production could not explain the greater soil carbon stock, suggesting that forest growth impacted this microbial process that controlled rates of soil carbon balance together with litter and soil respiration. The results highlight the importance of the development stage in assessing soil carbon budget and its significance to future management of Chinese fir plantations.",

Despite a 14% lower tree density and a lower tree height in the oak stand, standing biomass was slightly higher than in the pine stand (177 and 169 Mg ha-1 in oaks and pines, respectively), indicating that individual oak trees contained more biomass than pine trees of similar diameter. Moreover, NPP in the oak stand was more than double that in the pine stand (17.7 and 8.1 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively). Several observations indicated that soil organic matter accumulated at higher rates under pines than under oaks. We therefore hypothesized that the pines were exhibiting an age-related decline in productivity due to nutrient limitation. The poor decomposability of pine litter resulted in the observed accumulation of organic matter. The subsequent immobilization of nutrients in the organic matter, combined with the already nutrient-poor soil conditions, resulted in a decrease in total NPP over time, as well as in a substantial shift in the allocation of NPP toward fine roots. In the oak stand, litter is less recalcitrant to decay and soil acidity is less severe; hence, organic matter does not accumulate and nutrients are recycled. This probably explains why NPP was much higher in the oaks than in the pines and why only a small proportion of NPP was allocated to oak fine roots.",

Using empirical relationships derived from a global analysis, we predicted potential aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) for the region's regrowth forests based on soil texture and climate data. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soils, the globally derived relationship provided a nearly unbiased linear predictor of Amazonian validation data consisting of 66 stands at seven sites; there was no significant difference between stands that regrew following use as pasture land and those that regrew following slash-and-burn agriculture. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soil, the 1 sigma error range of our ABA model was 58%-171% for the Amazonian validation data. For regrowth forests on sandy soils, the validation data were limited to 19 stands at one site, and the globally derived relationship was substantially biased multiplicatively and nonlinearly. Hence we developed a regional refinement by adding to our validation data ABA values from the two Amazonian sites with sandy soil that had previously been included in the global analysis. Based on a conservative jackknife goodness-of-fit assessment (leaving out one site at a time), we calculated a 1 sigma error range of 42%-158% for our sandy soil Amazonian regrowth forest ABA model. We present our predictions of potential regrowth forest ABA as a set of 0.5Â° resolution maps for the region at 5, 10, and 20 years following abandonment. ",

The sites chosen were: 40-year-old first rotation stands, 12, 20 and a 30-year-old second rotation stands, one 18-month-old clearfelled site and unplanted natural grassland sites. The soil carbon stock of the first-rotation 40-year-old stands was 140Â Â±Â 15Â tÂ CÂ ha-1, far lower than in the surrounding unplanted grasslands (274Â Â±Â 54Â tÂ CÂ ha-1), while clearfelling caused a further decline (100Â Â±Â 13Â tÂ CÂ ha-1).

Soil respiration was the highest at the grassland site (14.2Â Â±Â 3.1Â tÂ CÂ ha-1Â year-1), possibly due to high respiration by the grasses.

In addition, data of photosynthesis of dominant tree species and seedlings, leaf area index, litter production and decomposing speed, soil moisture, soil temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density within the forest were all measured concurrently. Data from January 2003 to December 2004 are used to present annual variability of carbon flux and relationships between carbon flux and impact factors. The results show that carbon flux of this forest presented unusual tendency of annual variation; above-canopy carbon fluxes were negative in the dry season (November-April) and mainly positive in the rainy season, but overall the forest is a carbon sink. Carbon flux has obviously diurnal variation in this tropical seasonal rain forest. Above-canopy carbon fluxes were negative in the day-time and absolute values were larger in the dry season than that in the rainy season, causing the forest to act as a carbon sink; at night, carbon fluxes were mainly positive, causing the forest to act as a carbon source. Dominant tree species have greater photosynthesis capability than that of seedlings, which have a great effect on above-canopy carbon flux. There was a significant correlation between above-canopy carbon flux and rate of photosynthesis of tree species. There was also a significant correlation between above-canopy carbon flux and rate of photosynthesis of seedlings; however, the below-canopy carbon flux was only significantly correlated with rate of photosynthesis of seedlings during the hot-dry season. Soil respiration of the three treatments displayed a markedly seasonal dynamic; in addition, above-canopy carbon fluxes correlated well with soil respiration, litterfall pro-duction, litterfall decomposition rate, precipitation, and soil moisture and temperature.

Litter respiration with normal and double litter treatments exhibited similar seasonal variation, with the maximum value obtained in summer (0.57 and 1.51 Âµmol m-2 s-1 under normal and double litter conditions, respectively) and the minimum in spring (0.27 and 0.69 Âµmol m-2 s-1 under normal and double litter conditions, respectively).

Litter respiration was significantly higher in 2010 and 2012 than in 2011 under both normal litter (132-165 g C m-2 y-1 vs. 48 g C m-2 y-1) and double litter (389-418 g C m-2 y-1 vs. 93 g C m-2 y-1) conditions. Such significant interannual variations were largely ascribed to the differences in summer rainfall. Our study demonstrates that, apart from soil temperature, moisture also has significant influence on litter respiration in semi-arid regions. ",

This study aimed to assess the effects of long-term precipitation decrease on soil respiration in a tropical rainforest.MethodsA precipitation reduction experiment was conducted in a tropical forest in southwest China at the beginning of 2011. Soil respiration and environmental parameters were measured monthly for three years.ResultsThe continuous precipitation reduction treatment did not affect the seasonal patterns of soil respiration, but it significantly increased soil respiration in the study plot during the rainy season, and the relationship between soil respiration and soil moisture differed in the control and reduction treatment in the rainy season. Compared with the net ecosystem exchange of carbon in this system, the increment of annual soil carbon emissions in the reduction treatment was considerable and should not be ignored.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the responses of soil respiration to precipitation decrease may vary seasonally and the variation of volumetric water content in different seasons may be an important factor leading to the seasonal variation. The variation of soil moisture among different ecosystems as well as in different seasons should be taken into consideration when predicting the future response of soil respiration to drought globally.",

Litterfall was intensively studied during the period of 1982-2001 in two subtropical monsoon vegetation gradients in the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong Province, China. The two gradients include: (1) a successional gradient composed of pine forest (PF), mixed pine and broadleaved forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (BF), and (2) an altitudinal gradient composed of Baiyunci ravine rain forest (BRF), Qingyunci ravine rain forest (QRF), BF and mountainous evergreen broadleaved forest (MMF). Mean annual litterfall production was 356, 861 and 849Â gÂ m-2 for PF, MF and BF of the successional gradient, and 1016, 1061, 849 and 489Â gÂ m-2 for BRF, QRF, BF and MMF of the altitudinal gradient, respectively. As expected, mean annual litterfall of the pioneer forest PF was the lowest, but rapidly increased over the observation period while those in other forests were relatively stable, confirming that forest litterfall production is closely related to successional stages and growth patterns. Leaf proportions of total litterfall in PF, MF, BF, BRF, QRF and MMF were 76.4%, 68.4%, 56.8%, 55.7%, 57.6% and 69.2%, respectively, which were consistent with the results from studies in other evergreen broadleaved forests. Our analysis on litterfall monthly distributions indicated that litterfall production was much higher during the period of April to September compared to other months for all studied forest types. Although there were significant impacts of some climate variables (maximum and effective temperatures) on litterfall production in some of the studied forests, the mechanisms of how climate factors (temperature and rainfall) interactively affect litterfall await further study.",

In a small catchment of the semiarid Loess Plateau in China, soil respiration and soil biophysical factors were studied on sites of five forest types, comprising plots established in a pure Pinus tabulaeformis plantation, a pure Robinia pseudoacacia plantation, a mixed P.Â tabulaeformis and R.Â pseudoacacia plantation, a pure Platycladus orientalis plantation, and a natural Populus davidiana stand. Soil temperature at the 10Â cm depth was found to be the most predominant factor controlling the temporal pattern of soil respiration, accounting for 11-40% seasonal variation in the rate of soil CO2 efflux across forest types. By applying an empirical model and the calculated temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) and the rate of basal soil respiration (R10), annual soil CO2 emission was estimated separately for each forest type using the automatically monitored data of soil temperature at the 10Â cm depth. The annual soil CO2 emission varied greatly with forest types and ranged from 647.71Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in the P.Â orientalis plantation to 1448.50Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â y-1 in the natural P.Â davidiana stand. Annual soil CO2 efflux is better predicted by soil organic carbon content and the amount of carbon in roots, litter and top soil than soil temperature when data are pooled for all plots of the five forest types. A first order exponential analysis indicates that about 77% of the variation in annual soil CO2 efflux is explained by root carbon stock, 63% by the combined carbon stock in roots, litter, and top soil, and 48% by the combined carbon stock in litter and top soil. We conclude that annual soil CO2 efflux can be predicted by carbon pools in roots and soils rather than by soil temperature in watersheds where spatial variation in soil temperature is relatively small in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China.",

An open-path eddy-covariance (EC) system was used to continuously measure the carbon, water, and energy fluxes in a poplar plantation during the growing season (i.e., April-October) over the period 2006-2008 in the Daxing District of Beijing, China. We examined the seasonal and inter-annual variability of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem respiration (ER). Although annual total precipitation was the lowest in 2006, natural rainfall was amended by flood irrigation. In contrast, no supplementary water was provided during a severe drought in spring (i.e., April-June), 2007, resulting in a significant reduction in net ecosystem production (NEPÂ =Â -NEE). This resulted from the combined effects of larger decrease in GEP than that in ER. Despite the drought - induced reduction in NEP, the plantation forest was a strong carbon sink accumulating 591Â Â±Â 62, 641Â Â±Â 71, and 929Â Â±Â 75Â gÂ CÂ m-2Â year-1 for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The timing of the drought significantly affected the annual GEP. Severe drought during canopy development induced a lasting reduction in carbon exchange throughout the growing season, while the severe drought at the end of growing season did not significantly reduce carbon uptake. Additionally, irrigation reduced negative drought impacts on carbon sequestration. Overall, this fast growing poplar plantation is a strong carbon sink and is sensitive to the changes in environmental conditions.",

Soil CO2 respiration descended along the SRB as did the diversity of vegetation species, air temperature and air humidity. The two sites of the field station (FS) and the north desert (ND) and the low reaches of the SRB among these locations were monitored to analyze the effects of pH value, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on soil CO2 respiration during the growing season in 2005. The ND site was located at the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert; the FS site was in the border area of the SRB Alluvial Fan. One-way ANOVA was performed. The result showed that air humidity and CaCO3 content had a strong influence on soil CO2 respiration; SOC content was a limitation to soil CO2 respiration in the arid-desert zone. Effective management activities can attenuate soil CO2 respiration and keep carbon balance trends at a desirabe level in desert scrublands.",

Total Rs declined by about 61% during the night as a result of variations in respiration rate in the litter, which were partly correlated with the soil surface air temperature. Most of the diurnal variation of Rs in this TMCF appears to be driven by respiration in the litter layer, which contributed 37% to the total soil CO2 efflux.

The impact of this program on the carbon budget of soil has not been evaluated until now. This paper presents results from a 6-year study of total CO2 efflux from both soil and litter (R total), CO2 flux from soil (R soil), soil organic matter (SOM), soil microbe density, and litter input and root biomass at an uncut larch (Larix gmelinii) forest and at a natural restoration site. The natural restoration area is a clear-cut site that was formerly part of a continuous portion of the uncut larch forest. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify the magnitude of CO2 efflux from typical sites in northeastern China; (2) explore the changes in thermal conditions, SOM, and annual CO2 flux during the 6-year natural restoration, and (3) evaluate the impact of NFCP on soil carbon processes. The annual R soil at the clear-cut site (58.6-68.2Â mol m - 2Â year - 1) was 113.6-228.4% (mean 141.5%) higher than that at the uncut larch site (29.6-58.4Â mol m - 2Â year - 1). At the same time, annual CO2 from litter at the clear-cut site (2.0-14.2Â mol m - 2Â year - 1) was only 23.5-84.5% (mean 52.5%) of that at the uncut larch site (5.4-16.8Â mol m - 2Â year - 1). SOM at the surface layer of the clear-cut site was 75% of that at the uncut larch site, but the soil microbial biomass (carbon) at the clear-cut site was much higher than that at the larch site (p < 0.05). The percentage of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes also were largely different between both sites. Natural restoration at the clear-cut site strongly affected thermal conditions. Although the soil temperature (T soil) and effective accumulated \(T_{\rm soil} > 0^{\circ}\)C at the clear-cut site was much higher, the temperature sensitivity (Q 10) was much lower than that at the uncut larch site, and their differences decreased linearly from 2001 to 2006 (p < 0.05). Moreover, Q 10 at the clear-cut site significantly increased with the progress of natural restoration, which diminished the Q 10 difference between the two sites (slope = - 0.2792, r 2 = 0.4744, p < 0.05). These data imply that the NFCP natural restoration process has positively recovered the thermal condition of the clear-cut site to the level of uncut larch forest during the 6-year period. However, linear regression analysis showed that the 6-year natural restoration only slightly affected the annual soil CO2 efflux and SOM at both sites, and also did not diminish the differences between the two sites (p > 0.10), indicating that a much longer time is necessary to restore the soil carbon in the clear-cut site.",
