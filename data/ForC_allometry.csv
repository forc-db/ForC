31,Gonzalez-Akre_2016_potm,"Stem biomass was estimated using local and species-specific biomass allometries, when possible (Appendix S1: Table S2). Allometric equations were obtained from existing compilations for North America (Jenkins et al. 2004, Chojnacky et al. 2014). For each species, we selected among available allometries in the following order of priority: (1) species-specific allometries > genus-specific allometries > family-specific allometries; (2) proximity to site > regional allometries. When no biomass regressions were found for a particular species (n = 11) at any taxonomical level, we used the generalized equation for mixed woods in Jenkins et al. (2004).  "
