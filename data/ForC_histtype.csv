Establishment,Establishment of oldest trees,"Establishment of oldest trees. Date of establishment estimated based on age of the oldest trees (e.g., using cores and tree rings). This is not necessarily equal to the time of stand establishment, particularly for older stands. The year of Establishment of oldest trees can be calculated if both stand.age and measurement date are given in the traits table. For relatively young secondary forests, it was often assumed that date of Establishment of oldest trees = date of Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (assumption noted in est.regrowth.assumed.same.year field of ForC_history file).",NA
Establishment,Establishment of key species,Establishment of a keystone/ dominant tree species or taxa. Notes should specify the taxa.,NA
Regrowth(_prior),Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (natural),"Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (following significant disturbance) via natural succession. Date of event estimated based on land history records (e.g., records of fire history, satellite records of land cover, and interviews of land owners) or, for relatively young secondary stands, assumed equal to the date of establishmeng of oldest trees (assumption noted in est.regrowth.assumed.same.year field of ForC_history file).",NA

Disturbance(_prior),Cultivation,Any form of cultivation. Use Tillage if soil was tilled.,"months, seasons, years, harvests"
Disturbance(_prior),Cut,"Forest cutting, without removing (all) wood from site, or when it is unknown whether wood was removed from site. When wood was removed from site, ""Harvest"" is used.  100% tree mortality indicates clear-cutting.
