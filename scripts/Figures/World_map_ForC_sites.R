#we can use the basic open Esri.WorldImagery behind this and it works. Other maps can be obtained below.

#with mapview it is easy to change symbology, add legends, etc. This can be an option for the future.

library(ggmap)
get_map(source="google", maptype="hybrid")

#for whatever reason it won't let me download the map because it is "403 Forbidden." I have no idea if this is an IT issue or not.

#update: I asked Bill Fisher and he said it has something to do with the API key. I tried following his instructions for that but nothing worked. This is ok, tho, as RStudio has a built-in option that allows for different basemaps (select the layered symbol on left side of plot viewer after running  code).
