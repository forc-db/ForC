"Establishment","Establishment of oldest trees","Establishment of oldest trees. Date of establishment estimated based on age of the oldest trees (e.g., using cores and tree rings). This is not necessarily equal to the time of stand establishment, particularly for older stands. The year of Establishment of oldest trees can be calculated if both stand.age and measurement date are given in the traits table. For relatively young secondary forests, it was often assumed that date of Establishment of oldest trees = date of Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (assumption noted in est.regrowth.assumed.same.year field of ForC_history file).",NA,"Establishment","Establishment of oldest trees"
